message: "Guys, I'm starting a hobby project in C++ that will runs in *nix environment.
  It's merely calling a set of standard REST web services in a large scale, so I'm
  looking for the most lightweight, performant, and uncluttered way of doing it. My
  current options are:\n\n1. Visual Studio as an IDE (productive), KDevelop and CMake
  to generate linux native executable (the most appealing option until now)\n\n2.
  \ C++.NET and Mono. It unlock the power of .NET, yet still concerned about performance
  and Mono support on the long run \n\nWhat you think?"
