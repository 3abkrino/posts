message: "Guys, I'm starting a hobby project in C++ that will runs in *nix environment.
  It's merely calling a set of standard REST web services in a large scale, so I'm
  looking for the most lightweight, performant, and uncluttered way of doing it. My
  current options are:\n\n1. Visual Studio as an IDE (productive), KDevelop and CMake
  to generate linux native executable (the most appealing option until now)\n\n2.
  \ C++.NET and Mono. It unlock the power of .NET, yet still concerned about performance
  and Mono support on the long run \n\nWhat you think?"

      always configure it to build using whatever command line utility you want.

    message: "I didn't work with .Net frameworks before. So I'll vote with KDevelop
      and CMake combo. \nBecause CMake is a cross platform build system. You can generate
      build files for VIsual Studio(Windows), XCode (Mac OS), Makefile (Unix) and
      finally Eclipse CDT projects (and other build systems I never used). \nSo if
      you want your project to be cross platform then go for KDevelop and CMake combo."

      - I am using CMake, makes my build environment easier.
      - I use geany (text editor), sometimes vim. I have developed two different distributed tasks schedulers using python and C++ with them :D and it was a very good experience :D
      - I always write scripts that install all my application dependencies ..
      - Besides the dev. environment, you will need a good client (lightweight with good performance), what are your current options?
