  hello, everyone.
  I was wondering if you guys can help me on something.
  I'm required to build a website, just the front-end of it, and I am required to write javascript code that would allow the nav bar background color to change when the user clicks a link (that targets an element on the page) or the user scrolls to that element so the background of the bar would be the same as that of the element.
  is there a plugin for that? I'm searching but my deadline is approaching.
  thanks a lot
