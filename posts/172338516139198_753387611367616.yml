  hello, everyone.
  I was wondering if you guys can help me on something.
  I'm required to build a website, just the front-end of it, and I am required to write javascript code that would allow the nav bar background color to change when the user clicks a link (that targets an element on the page) or the user scrolls to that element so the background of the bar would be the same as that of the element.
  is there a plugin for that? I'm searching but my deadline is approaching.
  thanks a lot

    message: This effect was popular in Bootstrap as "ScrollSpy". Check the "JavaScript"
      section in Bootstrap site if you use it, or google "scrollspy" if you don't.
      Some option from random googling https://github.com/sxalexander/jquery-scrollspy

      Well, I haven't used this myself, when I googled "/jquery-scrollspy firefox" (without quotes, the first result was a StackOverflow accepted answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10684210/scrollspy-jquery-doesnt-work-in-firefox-opera
      I hope it helps.

      sorry for not clarifying, but this is the version that didn't work:

      <script type="text/javascript">
       $('#element li a').click(function(){
       $('html body').animate({"scrollTop": $($(this).attr("href")).offset().top}, 1000);
       console.log("it worked!");
       });
       </script>

      I'll use scrollpy though, I'm reading the documentation. thanks a lot for help
