  I'm dealing with Snort which is an IDS  (i.e. intrusion detection system).. it is installed on server that runs MySQL.. is it normal that unmalicious use generate a resulted code that contains "Select sys_exec(" ?
  because I'm sure that this string followed by a long string is a malicious activity.. so I wrote a rule to take this packets down.. but I don't want neither a lot of 'false-positive' alarms nor unmalicious packets to be dropped..  I'm not aware of the underlying code generated by MySQL so I want to know before add the rule.
