  I'm a RoR developer. I'm very satisfied with Ruby and RoR for web development. But I really like working/learning about algorithms and design patterns. And programming for non-web applications and solutions. Like embedded systems, security and other fields that i'm now aware of. So I want to know your opinion. Is transferring from web development to other fields is rewarding in regards to experience and salary ? I don't know exactly what fields use algorithms and other sophisticated programming concepts, I really enjoyed C++ a while ago. But I don't know if it's rewarding to learn C++ or should I just go with Java or other language ?

  (Note: So far I worked with PHP, Ruby. I have a little knowledge with Python. Tried .net two and half years ago, didn't go so well because of 70% of the egyptian market in .net was using web forms at that time)

  Thanks
