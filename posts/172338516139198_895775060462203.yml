  I googled a lot before posting here but I didn't find what I'm searching for. I need some recommendations for books about architecture in general. Most of the books that I found are old and I guess will be outdated. Web servers, Caching, In-memory stores, Key value stores,  Proxies, Load balancers, Message queues, Sharding and Replication of stores. I'm really interested in this kind of posts : https://github.com/blog/530-how-we-made-github-fast & http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html . The idea of thinking of and architecturing highly scalable systems and the design patterns used. Maybe what I'm asking for is too much for a single book but at least you got my point. I'd be really thankful if you could recommend some books or even the proper search keywords. Thank you.
  EDIT: The closest to what I'm searching for was "Service-Oriented design with Ruby and Rails" ( http://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321659368 ) it contains chapters about Load balancing, caching and messaging.

    message: Thank you for the books. I'll sure give them a try. But I have a question
      that may sound silly. When reading about architecture specially the kind of
      architecture I mentioned in the post, Shouldn't I be reading book that are published
      after maybe ~2009 or something ?

    message: Hi Muhammad Bassem, I understand what you mean and we, our-self, had
      the same impression you have now, but these books  are a must read because they
      are the basis of what "modern" enterprise architecture is. I encourage you to
      follow the authors' blogs because they are considered ones of the best software
      architects in the world till now.
