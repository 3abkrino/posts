  I have a technical question
  say I have a monthly subscription service that is using an RFID card

  we all know RFID cards can be cloned

  now if someone got a month description and cloned his RFID card to say 10 of his friends
  now this card is abusing the system and used 10 times instead of one time

  one solution I got is to limit the usage of the service by location i.e ( you cant use the service in Boston 5mins after using it in San Francisco. and this can be using location logging but it has a problems if the abusers use the service from the same hubs

  do you guys have any other solution to this problem? or is there any best-practice solution to this problem?
  to make the domain slightly specific lets say the service is a Ferry Transportation Service
  Ferries can take from 5 mins and upto 30 mins and even an hour in the sea crossing rivers and passing to islands

  sorry for the long post :D
