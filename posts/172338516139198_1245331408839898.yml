message: "In my lab, we're using some custom software for image acquisition for our
  imaging systems. The latest system's data throughput was > 3.2 GB/s. So, we were
  no longer able to acquire to SSDs without the software crashing* because their throughput
  is an order of magnitude less. \n\nI ended up turning off file caching and buffering**
  in the win32 file IO API, taking up ~35 gigs of RAM and setting them up as RAMdisk.
  I would stream to RAM this way, and then copy to disk after the fact. This setup
  limits the imaging session to ~ 10 seconds. The next step I'm taking is splitting
  the data writes over 2 PCIe SSDs. \n\nIs there anything I could do differently to
  handle this kind of throughput more efficiently? Do you perhaps know of some lossless
  compression algorithm that is fast enough? Something else?\n\n* Crashing is because
  of the buffer overflows in the acquisition card and because the software sucks.\n**
  If you ever want to do this, make sure that all the buffers you want to write to
  a file are page aligned. VirtualAlloc() lets you allocate page-aligned memory."

      Can't you subdivided the system to multiple nodes ?
      Can you add a GPU to the system ? Cuda enabled GPU's can do jpeg compression very well at very high speed

      Would a RAID 0 array of SSDs (4x to 8x) be able to cope with the data rates? or to minimize the delay after the capture in RAM disk?
      What are your SSDs throughput ?
