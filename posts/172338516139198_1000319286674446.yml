  I have been using this tool to get notified when people open my emails (and hence know whether they did at all). Very useful in 2 different scenarios:

  - You are sending an email to someone and you don't have other way to contact and confirm they opened it

  - You are sending a broadcast when a mailing list tool is not available (like meetup usergroup emails), and you want to know how many people opened it

  Normally you get 200 reading notifications per month for free.
  But...
  With this link, you and I get unlimited notifications for a month. Win Win :)
