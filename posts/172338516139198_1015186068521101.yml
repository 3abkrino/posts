      Do you have high concurrency problems? If yes, let's talk specifics, if not, do not prematurely optimize.

      In .NET there are 3 options: Web API (builtin, free), Nancy Fx (free), and ServiceStack (commercial for anything serious).

      They all do the job well. Web API is dominant when finding developers with skills matter. Go with it till you hit a roadblock.

    message: I second Negm though. There is not much point in using Mono for high
      performance / concurrency requirements. You'll get this from IIS, but Mono isn't
      abused badly enough, so it doesn't have solutions to these problems, as not
      enough users had it.
