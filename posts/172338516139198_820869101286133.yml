  I open a lot of tabs on firefox, and I mean A LOT! I was searching for addons to help me close tabs as fast as I open them so that I would keep the rate of open tabs steady. The best I found was something that closed duplicate tabs.

  I usually have a lot of tabs from the same domain name open most of the time when I am researching something, or even when I am surfing facebook. So I thought it would be cool if I could close tabs belonging to a specific domain name, and not just duplicate.

  I didn't find it, so I created it :)

  Pretty basic, no optimization whatsoever, but here it is.
