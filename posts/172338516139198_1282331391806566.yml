message: I am going to develop a cross-platform mobile application using Google Maps
  API's as my graduation project. I was thinking of using Xamarin (C#) or PhoneGap(JavaScript).
  Since I am familiar with both C# and JS. Has anyone here experienced using those
  two environments? Or even a better one that suits a first timer?

      very easy specially if you have prior experience with web technologies like
      angularjs. Also I choose firebase as backend as a service for the database.
