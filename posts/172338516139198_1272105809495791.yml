  and installed the Sierra 10.12.1 update after I was running 10.12, on my 13\" mid-2014
  macbook pro retina display. \nAfter the update, I couldn't select a resolution higher
  than 1680*1050 although my screen resolution is 2560 x 1600. it was working fine
  on 10.12.\nAnyone can help, please :("
