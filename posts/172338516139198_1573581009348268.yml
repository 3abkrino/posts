    message: "I don't have a previous background but I am at the moment studying to
      be one, can you tell me what do you know about exploitation in general? \n\nI
      suppose you have a good background in programming, compilers and other computer
      science concepts but you don't know anything about this, you should start by
      learning about reverse engineering and then proceed to exploitation.\nA great
      book about reverse engineering for beginners would be https://beginners.re/\nthis
      will teach you assembly, how computer works at low level..etc\nafter getting
      some knowledge you should get your hands dirty by doing some challenges, reversing
      challenges in general will help you I suppose.\nthere is a great channel called
      liveoverflow that may help: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w\ncheck
      it and you will find a lot of  challenges that he solved and recorded.\nif you
      have any questions I will do my best to help"
