    message: nothing is absolute  , yes this will make it harder against dictionary
      attacks & brute forcing bu for attacks like but so does inserting a special
      characters [and i think there is a high possibility someone will use an Arabic
      dictionary/character list against you anyway if the attack is targeted ] but
      for something like hash cracking it depend on how common is your phrase , using
      something like "بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم " for example is a bad practice because
      for some reason this is a very common password in our communities and the hash
      for it is probably already calculated in every hash table designed for Arabic
      users  , this is all for nothing of course if the  website/service is not hashing/salting
      the passwords and storing it plain text

    message: "again nothing is absolute  , \" strong \" is a relative word that can
      only be defined if you know what you are measuring against , if the website
      is storing the password in plain text then even if you used Chinese/Arabic/hieroglyphics
      mix password it will not protect you for a second against and server side attack
      like SQLI , this also apply if the website is not using SSL \n\nhashing power
      is not a factor if the password is common [without salt ] , the password would
      be already calculated and would be the same as plain text"
