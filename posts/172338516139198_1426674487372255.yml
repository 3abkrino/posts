      Wordpress is secure because it is opensource with comercial backing which is interested in keeping it secure as well as a large community of users thus making it of interest to pentesters and whitehat hackers. I am not sure why you believe wordpress is not secure.

      Don't make your own, I can guarantee that your solution would be less secure than wordpress even if you have a degree in security since wordpress has been around for long enough to have gotten over security issues that you would run into the first time around.
