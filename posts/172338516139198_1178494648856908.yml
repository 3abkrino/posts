  hello,
  did anyone here try to make a program that uses proxy to connect to a website ?
  am trying to do that but i keep failing.
  i already tried Java
  using jsoup and System.getProperties, it works but some websites detect my real ip (ex google , yahoo, ... )

      hi, about my problem i fixed it by using python instead of java.
      and it worked the way i wanted it to  :)
      but i still don't understand how google/other websites can detect me when i used java, but not when i use python

      seems that the proxy properties need to be set using connection.proxy(). so
      the reason might be that jsoup ignored the proxy system properties, and you
      didn't provide any proxy to the connection.\n\ntry adding .proxy( .... ) before
      the .execute()"
