      اشمعنا Lenovo و I5؟؟
      أجمد Lenovo هو أجمد مواصفات في الـ W series، إلا لو عايز touchscreen يبقى أجمد مواصفات في الـ T series - حيث أجمد مواصفات دي حاجة حسب فلوسك و المتوفر في البلد اللي أنت فيها.

    message: Just make sure you get an SSD, this is your bottleneck 99% of the time,
      so no matter how fast or how many cores the processor has if you didn't invest
      a little bit more in an SSD you will find mediocre performance.

      years old now, I wrote it off as dead couple of years ago because of performance
      then I decided to give it a shot and got a 64GB SSD in it, and it was brought
      back from the dead, it does everything I usually do online without a hitch.
