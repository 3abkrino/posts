      Well, location isn't a big deal, i have am app that needs to be developed and i think it only needs basic skills like tables, and charts, menu, read RSS ... nothing more ... actually i can do it as an html5 mobile page but i prefer to be a dedicated app.

      please add me if you are interested...

    message: RSS/XML parsing isn't a trivial task, and sadly, I have no experience
      with either, sorry.

    message: i think if you have successfully built your hello world app this would
      be easy to find a code snippet that parse RSS/XML. will any way i will give
      you some hints about the app later and you can check if you will be able to
      handle it or not :)

    message: I'm working on a twitter app right now, so I'm not an absolute beginner,
      I've already looked for a way to parse RSS, and all I found was people who were
      looking for decent libraries to do just that.
