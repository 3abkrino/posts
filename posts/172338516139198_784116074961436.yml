    message: 'I used it once, I remember: turning jQuery plugins into directives was
      a pain specially when you have a lot of them, flickering problems, multiple/nested
      views problems'

    message: I see what you mean on jquery plugins. Can you name some examples please?
      I also didn't get the views problem. Thanks a lot.

    message: "For plugins I remember jQuery Raty, typeahead.js (Thank god I found
      it included in Angular UI) and some not-so-popular image sliders and charts.
      \n\nFor the views problem, I wanted to load ng-views inside each others and
      keep the 'state' of all of them, have a look at the attached shots, in photo
      1 the user searches estate agents and gets a list, when an item is clicked the
      details view should appear with animation on the right and the clicked item
      on the main ng-view gets highlighted and all its state including pagination,
      search term, sort.. etc should remain.. after struggling with this I had to
      use Angular UI Router and remove some features I was planning to do, I thought
      stuff like these are definitely supported and I can go crazy as much as I want
      but I had to find a workaround for almost everything I wanted to do, making
      them with jQuery would be a lot easier actually but I wanted to try angular.js
      and I loved it anyway"

    message: Routing is something where Ember really exists and Angular is quite behind
      (maybe until 2.0 this will remain the case). Don't feel bad about using ui-router
      BTW, it's way more superior, and the guys who created it are pretty much Angular
      team or so close to it, plus it's going to be main source of inspiration for
      angular router in 2.0, and so many people and places recommend using it by default.
