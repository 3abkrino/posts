  SA,
  I'd like to ask you guys about the perfect approach for implementing models in your Express.js web apps.
  I have found many approaches, but I'd like to hear from you.
  I'm using models as static classes to hold my methods no more. Is that okay? Should I implement prototypes/data as well? Why?
  Thanks in advance.

    message: I would seriously suggest that if you use nodejs to use typescript since
      it makes catching mistakes a lot easier. As for your questions I have my models
      doing validation as well as acting as an encapsulating class to allow for extracting
      relevant params from web requests and database responses and add helper functions
      and attributes that I can then use throughout the code. Also since I use typescript
      it allows me to type methods to accept certain models and get simple type checking.
