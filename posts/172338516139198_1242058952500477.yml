  Guys, I'm developing a back-end web service to be consumed by diff. mobile applications and/or web clients. I'm evaluating between 2 alternatives: 1) PHP and 2) NodeJS. I know deciding is a pretty subjective topic, so let me tell you the criteria I'm basing off the decision and I'd love to hear your comments. I'm leaning towards NodeJS but there is nothing better than collective wisdom especially among such a group of GEEKS :)

  Criteria:
  1) Availability of Skill Set: PHP is more abundant especially in Egypt but NodeJS is growing rapidly
  2) Fit for application: NodeJS parallelism beats PHP on that front
  3) Market Presence: PHP is leading of course but NodeJS is growing pretty fast
  4) Ease of Coding: NodeJS is faster in the development cycle
  5) Cost to Outsource: NodeJS tend to be more expensive just because they are less. But I think prices will converge pretty soon and more importantly a developer updating his/her skill set to cope with the market is likely to deliver better results as he keeps developing him/her self so price for quality should be the same or NodeJS would exceed in that bit

  As mentioned, It's a pretty subjective pick but I'd love to hear your feedbacks and please mention other criteria that I might have missed.
  (PS I'll post the requirement for someone to help build the codebase on EgyptianGeeksJobs when my membership is confirmed and I take the final decision)

  Awaiting replies (and sorry for the long post)

    message: if the project is big, things can get complicated with writing a lot
      of javascript. PHP frameworks are more mature I guess. If you will need real
      time stuff or websockets, you can run nodejs for that purpose only beside php
      instance. You don't need to make your whole solution in nodejs for that.
