message: "Hay Guys ,\n\nCertain payment gateway says that its commission is 5% per
  transaction .\n\nAssuming the amount is 100$ \nWhat is the difference between calculating
  the commission like this:\n\n100%  => 100$\n5%  => X$\n\nx = 5$\n\nand\n\n95%  =>
  100$\n5%  => X$\n\nx = 5.3$\n\nBecause the gateway is using the Second method and
  i think this is fraud , am i right ?\n\nWhen i sent them my investigation they replied
  that it is a mistake and we'll make your commission exclusively 4.5% !!!"

      It's basically the same, but in the second method it calculate the amount that you transfer as the final amount, instead of charging commission from it.

      And I think most banks do the same

      get 5% = 5$ \n\nthen they add 100$ + 5$ = 105$ \n\nand calculates their commission

    message: Payment gateways are always based on volume and negotiations. So be smart
      when you negotiate it 5% is too high rate. Ideally you should be between 3%
      and 4% or 3.5 and a small processing fees
