message: "Salam 3likom..\nIs there any unified communication app (free or open source)
  for team collaboration up to 50 employees ? \nI know dozens but with pricing conditions
  also missing a lot of features.\nI used M.S Lync for about  4 years and it was enough,
  now I have moved to a new environment with missing U.C methodologies .\nKindly advise."
