  Hello all,
  this is more of a philosophical post that I would like to hear your opinion on it, as we all know during the mid 90s till around 2005, the technologies were going in steady pace, with a mindset of using the current tools that we have like programming languages, operating systems, frameworks, etc, till we reach it limitations then we decide to move on and invent new tools that fits our current needs, but from 2008 going forward till now, this mindset changed dramatically, as more companies and individuals create new technologies and framework everyday instead of just improving of what we already have, even though most of the times the goals are pretty similar with each other, a complete new mindset that sometimes reinvent the wheel instead of improving the current technologies that frankly it still have room to develop, for example on my recent search for a chart drawing library in JavaScript I was shocked seeing more than a dozen and even more that aim for the same goals and spent a hard time to choose one of them, and the example can be found in programming languages, frameworks libraries and even operating systems, and sometimes I feel big companies try to reinvent the same frameworks to lock it's customers to use their technologies.
  They taught us that we shouldn't reinvent the wheel in the past, put the current philosophy is that you should reinvent the wheel who knows maybe you can make a better wheel than the current one.
  So what do you think guys is the current approach is the right one, or the old approach of improving till we reach the limit is the right choice.

    message: this is a really good point, and i think that's why communities and things
      like github are there, so the good could only flourish, but the diversity of
      the products does not mean they are similar, i could write hello world in like
      9 languages, but every language of them i'll use for a specific thing, that
      doesn't mean that this is redundant, it just means that you could use more preferred
      tool or language to finish your project

      دي طبيعة أي علم, بيتوسع بشكل مخيف
      من عشرين سنة مثلاً كان ممكن تقول على واحد مبرمج كمبيوتر (اللي هو بيعرف يعمل أي أبليكيشن - عادة كان بالسي او اخواتها علشان يشتغل على ال Console)
      دلوقتي انت بتكتب كود علشان يشتغل موبايل ولا ويب ولا ديسكتوب ولا امبدد ولا بوت ولا بيج داتا ولا iot ولا plugin
      فوق اي لغة انت بقا عندك كمية services محتاج تتعامل معاها
      محتاج حاجات تانية علشان: UI, UX, Security, Optimization, Data access abstraction, Caching, Parallelism, Communication
      وكل ماحتاجاتنا بتزيد حاجات كتير هاتطلع
      مشكلتنا ان الدنيا بقت كبيرة علينا اوي, والجامد في مجالنا بيعرف مثلاً 5% منه بس
