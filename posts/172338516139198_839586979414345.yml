      yeah I'm getting "$$ is undefined" in both IE 11 and Chrome 32 when pressing on the button or when entering it in the address bar, but works fine when entered into the console.
      I'm not very good with JS and it's the first time for me to see this "$$", I only know the "$" from jQuery :D
      Is there a replacement for $$ part?

      yeah I know that it's not part of jQuery (I don't see any <script> tags in the page you made), it seems to be part of plain-old JS that I never heard of before.
      I didn't know normal JS had a way to select things based on CSS selectors, I thought it was a jQuery thing, so I just learned something new today :D
