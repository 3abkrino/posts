  Salam ALLAH
  I want to ask about Angular and SEO ?!! :)
  Currently we are working on a big eCommerce website and i preferred to use Angular, signalR and some of technologies but i surprised when i got a recommendation from one of the biggest SEO companies on the glob that they asked me what about if the user disabled his java script?!!!
  I got confused shall i repeat my work again to overcome that issue!!
  Please advise  :(

      The question isn't who is disabling JavaScript ... The question is how search engines would crawl a website that is heavily dependent on JavaScript ... I would recommend you check this article http://www.yearofmoo.com/2012/11/angularjs-and-seo.html
      Although I would generally go against using Angular for the whole eCommerce solution. Perhaps use it in some parts (filtering, search ...) not the whole thing

    message: And they are right ... if you are building a tool like Basecamp, Harvest
      or anything that shouldn't be crawled I would say go for Angular or any other
      JS frameworks ... But Angular for an eCommerce? Hell no :D You will definitely
      face a lot of challenges to make it work + you will have to do a lot of work
      to prefetch and render on the server if a crawling bot tried to access the website.
      Good luck

      implemented a small proof of concept. \nFirst :Google started gradually to index
      the websites that use javascript in rendering \nhttp://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html?m=1\n\nSecond,
      for the other search engines, as per the seo standards,  they change the part
      of the url that is used by the js libraries (!#) so simply you can intercept
      the httprequest that is coming from the search engine crawler and pre-fetch
      the page thin give it as loaded html to the search engine. You can use PhantomJs
      to do so.\n\nhttp://phantomjs.org"

      Ajax one with executing the js for the normal page and another one with the
      !# replacement or fragment tag way \n\n* from the simulation of Google crawler
      provided by Google:\nthey execute the js without the !# replacement or the fragment
      tag\n\nnote that : better to use !#  than fragment tag , as i noticed that when
      i use fragment tag it doesn't execute the js first time and executes the second
      time, but when i use !# it executes the js from the first time\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*in
      my view  it is better if you detect the crawler with the !# and use phantomJS
      to execute the js on the server ( if the user is a crawler ) so you will be
      sure that it will work whatever they search engine support js executing or not.
      and make both methods result are SEO friendly not only the output of the phantomjs
      method."
