  I want to ask about Angular and SEO ?!! :)
  Currently we are working on a big eCommerce website and i preferred to use Angular, signalR and some of technologies but i surprised when i got a recommendation from one of the biggest SEO companies on the glob that they asked me what about if the user disabled his java script?!!!
  I got confused shall i repeat my work again to overcome that issue!!
  Please advise  :(
