  I'm having terrible with remembering all node.js core module's methods, for who was facing my situation, what is the best way to learn node.js core modules? and I mean by that is to fully understand every specific module.
  thanks..

    message: That's what docs are for, and I think you can also use some node type
      definition either by using something like TypeScript or Babel which most modern
      editors like VS Code or Atom will do auto completion for you.

      functionality instead, and deep dive when needed
