    message: Never get a non-SSD drive ... the mechanical (normal) ones days are over,
      the SSDs used to be unreliable but now the situation is reversed ... SSDs are
      getting cheaper by the moment and they deliver a huge performance improvement
      over normal ones.. the question is how much is your budget?

      I would really recommend Samsung EVO (or Pro if you have the money), I got a Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB SSD last February, it cost 1400 EGP but it's perfect :)
      I heard a lot of bad reviews about Kingston SSDs (they are the cheapest) so avoid them!

      Samsung is the most recommended one, and it comes with a software that optimizes Windows to write less.
      I think Samsung EVO 265GB costs 850LE

      If you are buying for a PC, then you can get a 120GB one for the system, and put the rest of your less used files (movies or iso) on an HDD
