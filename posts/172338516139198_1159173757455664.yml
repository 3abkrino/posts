    message: I am seriously considering moving to azure or somewhere else they are
      fucking me up ... my autoscaling group can not replace faulty instances and
      I only have 2 t2.micro machines healthy trying to handle ~4000 api requests/min
      from users ... I ended up setting my laptop and a local pc I have into the cluster
      to receive requests too using a load balancer above our amazon load balancer
