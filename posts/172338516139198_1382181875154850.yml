  Anyone here using cloud storage for personal, off-site backup purposes? Basically I need 1-2TB of storge space with the most important factor having an FTP or FTP-like access to upload and download (Web based upload sucks, and I don't want to auto sync files because this defeats the whole point of backup).

  All for something like $10/month... I have been searching for a day and none of the mainstream solutions (GDrive, OneDrive, etc.) fits, neither I found a low-end VPS with such disk space... maybe you can enlighten me with your experience?

  Thanks for your help!

      Update for anyone interested in this thread, after spending several weeks trying different backup workflows, I ended up with:

      Duplicati 2.x (freeware and awesome) on the clients + B2 Cloud storage from Backblaz ($0.005 per GB/m).

      An awesome combination that is easy on the wallet :)
