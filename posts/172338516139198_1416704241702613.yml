message: "Hi Folks, Do you have any recommendations for a software that \n\n1- allow
  reading different books formats (epub, pdf at least) \n2- sync the annotations and
  last page across different devices (macOs, Android, IOS)\n\nI have done a lot of
  research but non of the available solutions is able to satisfy  these conditions.
  \n\nFor those who love annotating books, how do you handle this across devices ?\n\nBTW,
  if there is no free options, I will be willing to purchase a good app that is able
  to do this :)"
