  Anyone using Gimp 2.8?

  - What does it add to, say, Paint.NET?

  - What plugins would you recommend for this version?
  (some older plugins seem to try to implement functionality that is now part of the official program itself)

      Paint.net has an easy & beautiful UI compared to GIMP, and startup time is better. Paint.net is lacking in its support for PSD files. A plugin exists to open it but it cannot handle large PSD files & layer groups. GIMP can work with PSDs natively, but I don't remember more details about PSD support.

      In short, use Paint.net if your needs are just for editing images (png, jpg, ...)

    message: I do use Paint.NET already, for several years, and including opening
      (mainly viewing) PSD files. Been considering Photoshop for long but it's too
      damn expensive even though my company provides me with software allowance. Been
      checking GIMP as it seems this 2.8 version has solved years-old Layers and Windows
      Layout issues.
