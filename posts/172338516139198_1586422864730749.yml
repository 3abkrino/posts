      Artificial Intelligence = When you try to make the computer do things like a human mind using programmed "artificial" intelligence, until at one moment the programmed intelligence start creating its own way of developing itself and thus moving beyond "artificial".
      Machine learning = Trying to make a system learn from vast amount of data and trying to uncover hidden relationships in this data and become more understanding of any new data that you feed it to this system.
      Data science = trying to learn how to do the above successfully and scientifically
