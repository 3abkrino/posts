  I'm using the active admin gem to install an admin interface to a web app I am currently building. thing is, it keeps saying that the email can't be blank, password cant be blank on running rake db:migrate, despite having the [AdminUser.create!(email: "admin@example.com"...) if direction == up] line written in the migration file.
  I tried every solution I could find online but nothing worked for me (even removing the generated code and updating/redownloading and regenerating everything).
  any help on that? did any of you encounter this error?
  I'm using rails 4.1.2
