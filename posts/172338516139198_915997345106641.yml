  Knowing that the world doesn't actually needs a new language .. but I would really like to share with you my new (uncompleted) dynamic language .. with an early draft of its specifications

  http://specs.quantitysystem.org/en/latest/RuntimeTypes.html

  the calculator can be tested on http://quantitysystem.org

  and the source code is available in http://quantitysystem.codeplex.com until I move it into github.

  emm the language is concerned about units conversion and keeping consistency of quantities regardless of used units.

  for example you can get the length with any unit you want .. aah and you can try currency conversion as well by writing  0<EGP>+1000<USD> for example :D
