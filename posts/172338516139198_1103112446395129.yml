    message: "AFAIK, Sentiment analysis is not a one subject that you can find one
      framework doing all the jobs for you (like scraping or crawling).\nSentiment
      analysis is a combination of two major branches in computer science which are
      Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The later branch is also a
      branch of Artificial Intelligence branch.\nFor Natural Language processing in
      python you will find NLTK toolkit. \nFor Machine learning there are two options,
      either scikit-learn or Spark-Mlib (the python version)\nscikit-learn is much
      mature than spark-mlib but if you want to use machine learning techniques in
      a scalable way, go for Spark-mlib.\nHope that help"
