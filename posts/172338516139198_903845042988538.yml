  Dear Geeks,

  I have recently asked whether I could write Python code on an Android device.

  The problem is I hate going on errands and having to wait, like in a bank for instance or at the doctors queue and I feel like a lot of time is wasted.

  Or when your wife takes you on a long family outing, you can still code on your Androind phone using this app:

  It also goes to show that maybe my prediction of Python dominating the web soon will come true, because since you can create mobile apps in Python and if it comes in so many devices, soon I expect no one will want to use Javascript with it's crappy syntax and bad debugging experience.

  Anyway, that is my wishful thinking, I hope the world catches up. Enjoy the app here:
