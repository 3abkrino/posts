      Static variables probably wont work, but using ASP.NET Session will work as far as I know.
      I'm not sure how they do it, but you'll find two cookies named "WAWebSiteID" and "ARRAffinity" that are used to make sessions "sticky".
      I think what happens is that the load balancer uses the values of these cookies to always direct you to the same server, so the same users would always get the same session values.
