  Hey WordPress gurus,

  What's the latest and greatest WordPress backup / import-export plugin or tooling of the day in April 2016?

  (Database, themes, plugins, extra files, and posts)

  P.S.
  I could obviously google for tools that do this. I'm flooded with results though. I was hoping for first hand experimenters recommendations instead of just more help googling.

  Thanks a lot :)

      It seems like you might get a good database backup plugin, but regarding the wp-content folder, you need to back it up on your own.
      Cannot we work together to write sth specific to our needs?

    message: "If you are working with a small size WordPress website, then I recommend\"\n-
      Duplicator (https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/). \n- Backup Buddy (https://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/)
      \n\nBackup Buddy is a paid plugin and slightly user friendly, Duplicator is
      just fine. The way these two plugins work is by backing up all your files and
      database into one zip file, in addition to a php \"extractor\" file.\n\nIf you
      are working with a larger website, having a 1GB+ zip backup of your website
      might not be that helpful when it's time to download/upload it. In that case,
      I would do a local backup and use an FTP for compare and sync, or git if you
      prefer, plus the database backup, manual or with a plugin. There is this powerful
      database backup tool https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/, if you
      want a git type workflow, and want to make database migration just as easy to
      push and pull (expensive for my needs but seems popular online).\n\nThere are
      also web hosting services that offer decent WordPress backup solutions and integration
      with git."

      I'm using a plugin called "BackWPup" for more than a year with no problems at all, i'm scheduling a weekly full backup to my Dropbox account and it works very smoothly.
