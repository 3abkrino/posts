  hello guys .. I was wondering about copyrights of open source projects .. let's assume that I have this wonderful library that is hosted on one of the famous code hosting vendors .. codeplex, github, etc.

  could this be enough to retain my copyright as an author ?!!!

  should I reserve a specific domain name for the code ?!!

  is there a foundation that could connect my identity to my work and ensure my copyrights ??

  looking for your insights pleaase :)
