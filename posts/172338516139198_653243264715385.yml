message: My company is looking for web engineers. We have been working on interesting
  problems lately and need some extra manpower(e.g. how to keep track of a billion
  dollars month, how to efficiently organize and distribute 737 pilots' flight schedule,
  etc). We are mainly working with .NET stacks although nowadays our infrastructure
  stacks are pretty diverse.  Send me your resume (or even better, github profile)
  to dodyg@silverkeytech.com.
