      if you are trying to build a single web page app you need to understand every
      thing about backbone because you will face a lot of problems during development
      so I think that two hours are not enough

    message: Hisham El-Sheshtawy you are welcome.. For me first time I tried to learn
      backbone.js I tried Lynda tutorials to understand the big picture then I tried
      some code it takes one day for that. After that I read a book to understand
      the details it take about two days..I think that I am a lazy person so you can
      learn it quicker than me.

    message: Hisham El-Sheshtawy you might need to use Marionette.js with backbone
      to organize the views it give you some classes like (layoutView ,collectionView,
      itemView) for me it was helpful.

      1- Addy Osmani's book is the best resource.
      2- Marionette is an indispensable add-on.
      3- Stackoverlow is your best friend!
