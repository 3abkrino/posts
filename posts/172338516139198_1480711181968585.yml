message: "I'm making a facebook-like android app.\nI have a problem in handling (like
  button state)\nwhen a user likes a post I make a request and store the user id and
  the post_id in a table called (likes) to force user to hit \"like\" once(actually
  i check the user id and post id every like request)\nthe problem appeared here:\nwhen
  I retrieve Posts list from mysql using php. all button backgrounds are in it's (initial
  state although this user hit like button before and the background had changed already)\n\nHow
  can I keep button background every time I retrieve data from mysql into my android
  app? \n#android #social_apps"
