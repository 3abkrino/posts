  guys i've an idea about a new activity in our group.

  after this post https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/734993243207053/

  i liked that debate between us. so why don't we have something like debates. for example PHP vs Ruby. and get the experts from both side to start the debate. i'll help the group members enhancing their skills. whta do you think guys?!
