message: "Why we can't define a method body (shared/static or instance) inside an
  interface to be applied on classes that implements this interface\nFor example if
  we have Customer and Provider who implements\n IContact { string Email{get;set;}}\nWhy
  we do not make void SendMail(string msgBody){\nMailClinetWhatEver.Send(Message=msgBody,To=this.Email
  )\n}\ninside IContact \nI know i can inherit from a base class that can do this"
