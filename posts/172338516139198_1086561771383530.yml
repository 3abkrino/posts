  Are you with or against GitFlow? Why?
  Based on what do you decide to use GitFlow for a project?
  ------------------------------------------------
  So, i have been reading about gitflow long ago but never really had the chance to use it as the workflow for a project from the beginning, but i have that chance now so i decided to use it but then started reading about opinions against gitflow as well, and i kinda feel lost in between so i thought i should listen to your experiences and opinions! :)

      Simple explanation for GitFlow WorkFlow: http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/

      Arguments against it: http://endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful
      and the follow-up: http://endoflineblog.com/follow-up-to-gitflow-considered-harmful

      I've read these articles and the comments as well but couldn't make up my mind, also searched the group here for similar discussions but found none.

    message: I'm against using anything as is. You should adapt to whatever makes
      you and your team comfortable and productive. Just like "agile" and people saying
      you're doing agile wrong or agile is better. Screw it. If you're happy with
      svn and it fits the bill, go for it.  When it comes to gitflow, I don't see
      it as a good starting point, but take a look at it, and take the parts that
      would make your life better.

      So why not?

    message: "Well, I too have read the argument against it, when we were making the
      shift to gitflow, and I found it to be bullshit. \n\nExcept for the history
      readability part, which is partially solved by tags in Gitflow, the other points
      seem to be emotional more than logical, and the dude seems to be disgruntled,
      nothing more.\n\nWe are having a little problem with GitFlow, but we have had
      the same exact problem with almost every other flow we had before, and it is
      highly related to our codebase.\n\nI agree with Hassan Ibraheem in general,
      but in this case I am very much for GitFlow.\n\nA few of the things i really
      love about GitFlow:\n\n1. When you use the \"git flow\" command, it is way harder
      to make mistakes, and take a branch from the wrong place, or merge a branch
      to the wrong branch, or rebase on an outdated branch. This takes away a lot
      of human errors.\n\n2. I like rebasing on top of develop branch, it keeps conflicts
      contained in feature branches, and leaves the develop branch intact till the
      developer deliberately decides to merge back into develop. Every developer will
      fix the conflicts on their feature branch, and only they will suffer from broken
      code, not the whole team.\n\n3. I like the concept of \"release\" branches,
      very much."

      really need all that overhead. \n\nThat being said, I personally use it for
      my own individual projects anyway. :)"
