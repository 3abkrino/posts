message: Hi guys, I have a traditional question regarding mobile development, it's
  about cross-platform vs native mobile development. I write mobile apps in C++ and
  Qt Quick, and  I see that many companies are using cross-platform technologies instead
  of native ones, and the number is dramatically increasing specially after releasing
  react native and Qt mobile support, so does anyone have a more in-depth knowledge
  about that? I have seen many discussions out there where people have stated that
  they use cross-platform technologies in most of their mobile development, around
  98%, but I need more experience-based opinions that take into account the cost of
  native app development and maintenance, if you have a good knowledge about that,
  please share.

      Writing C and C++ to create an app is usually not desirable. Use the right tool to get the job done. For ios you can always write your C++ along side swift or objc and call it directly without any problems. This is mainly for the cases where you already have some code written in c or c++ and you don't want to rewrite it. The same goes in Android I guess, Use the ndk. Qt is mainly for embedded systems and it will never compete in the mobile development area even though they support it. And you may need to pay them in order to use qt in  non open source project.

      Don't forget that you may end up facing problems when you submit your app to the app store in case you go for a non standard way to develop your app so why the hassle?

      Sure this depends on the app or the solution you're going to build.
      Simply I recommend:

      If simple app that doesn't use much native api's, go for Cordova.

      If you're building a product targeting multiple platforms, and you need the native experience, go for react native, native script or xamarin.

      Yet you must know that even with react you need to write modules using native
      tech to do stuff js cannot do alone,
