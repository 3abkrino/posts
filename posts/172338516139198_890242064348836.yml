      Most ORMs are not good for batch operations on millions of records. For this use case, people do on of these

      1. Use a product for data migration. Mainly MS SSIS
      2. C# program using SqlDataReader & family
      3. C# program using a micro ORM like dapper

      Just make sure to handle failures!
