  Hi,
  If I am buying a laptop mainly for coding and mild entertainment(no gaming or very light gaming). Should I go for an i7 or an i5 will be sufficient?

      i5 is fine in my opinion, coding will benefit more from an SSD than a faster processor, so make sure you have an SSD in this laptop.
      i7's are typically good for editing videos, images, simulation ... etc but gaming in general is fine with i5

      i7 is waste of money.
      i7 is i5 with a turbo and it works only if needed (gaming for example).
      So, i5 is the best choice.

    message: I was in your same position when i was buying my laptop ... i have made
      a lot of search on the internet and ended up that i7 won't give any extra benefit
      to my needs .. instead investing the extra money in buying more ram or switching
      to an ssd disk .. which unfortunately too expensive so i ended up with i5 and
      8gb ram and regular hard disk .. and is doing great

      I think i7 may be important if you are going for encryption and extreme intensive CPU requirement, else Go for i5 and invest in other aspects

      RAM
