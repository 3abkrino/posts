  Anybody here worked with Graphql before?
  If yes i need some help with subscription types implementation in the back end.
  I'm building my back end with c# and front end -mobile app- using react native with relay.
  I've done queries and mutations, but can't find a good example on how to make subscriptions in the back end.

  Thanks in advance
