  Hey fellow OSs geeks :D
  So unfortunately, my PC isn't good enough for Yosemite.. I suffered from constant lag and crashing.
  So I got back to the boring Windows 8.1 and I got bored again so I searched for something else and I found this amazing Linux distro called Deeping..
  I had some experience with Ubuntu in the past, but I hated the Unity DE.
  Now this distro is based on Ubuntu..so anything you can do/install on Ubuntu you can here.
  It looks amazing and it has some great features including it's own DE and Launcher. and it's packed with a decent music and video players and a great software store.
  You can download it from the official site here: http://www.linuxdeepin.com/index.en.html
