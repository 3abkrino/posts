message: "Will the next step in the evolution of Open Source be Open data.\nOpen source
  software has become the standard for this industry for years now ( not that much
  ) but we are moving towards a world where the software does not matter in itself
  anymore but the data it operates on that really does make a difference.\nThis industry
  was once controled by companies that owned and controled the source now it's owned
  by companies that own the data ( it's not ours anymore i guess once it's out there
  ) \nCan there be a model that shift big companies towards open data and change the
  industry for the better like open source once did ???\nWhat do you think?!!"

    message: Open data! That sounds very futuristic. I don't think we will see open
      data any soon at least due to privacy issues. Most of the current security breaches
      are mainly data leaks. I feel the current culture is way far from accepting
      open data as a model of sharing (as in open source)
