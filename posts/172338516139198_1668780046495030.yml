message: "The touch pad in my MacBook became glitchy, it jumps all over the screen
  and performs multiple clicks, then it returns to normal state after I switch to
  sleep mode. I did some research and I found some suggestions to switch to safe mode
  which didn't work for me. Any one faced a similar issue or knows how can Solve this
  ?! \n#macbook #apple"
