      A way to do this, is to think of a trigger that invokes a background task that task goes to your PHP endpoint and reads the data. the data probably is going to be labeled with a unique identifier of the UWP client app.

      For the trigger I think a Notification sent from your backend (PHP) would do. I didn't implement this before so I don't know whether there is a way to hide the incoming notification from the user.
