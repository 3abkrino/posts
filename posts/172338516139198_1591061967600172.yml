      for SAP S/4HANA \U0001F603\nBut it still depends on how you assess your business
      as medium/small..\nWhat is the type of manufacturing? process/chemical or discrete/assembly?\nWhat
      is the number of users?\nWhat type of reports do you expect from the system?\nWhat
      is your budget for the overall project? including Hardware, Licence, implementation
      and enhancements.. ?\nWould you hire sufficient internal staff to operate the
      system? Have you planned their training, etc... ?\nCan you run on cloud, or
      on-premises is a must for you?"

      cost you only 1 month subscription, or even free trial).
