  I've been away from this world for lots of time, I have done lots of readings but the docs and questions are quite contradictory, marketing I think screwed this world up.
  I am creating a play2.5 app and I want to pack it up with a non relational database, the db should have higher throughput for reads, writes are not that often I can say 1:4 rate.

  The ability to have multiple indexes over keys per table.
  and low ops load, one db that meets my use case is DynamoDB, but I want something without cloud provider lockin.

  Any suggestions?

      FAQ:
      Q: Did you look at mongodb?
      A: my experience with mongo was 3 years ago and it was quite a shitty experience in ops, if the ops load had changed from your experience, I'll be happy to embrace it.

      FAQ2:
      Q: did you look at Cassandra?
      A: Most of the stuff seems to be sponsored content, marketing it as the defacto nosql, which gives me some shivers, need someone who worked closely with it to say so.
