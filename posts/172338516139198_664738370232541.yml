  At work, I am about to build a SOAP API in PHP.

  I am considering one of two options. Either using the native SoapServer class in PHP or Zend_Soap_Server class.

  Does anybody here have any recommendations, or tips on which way to go?!

  Or does anybody have any useful resources to read?!

      I have seen this article. The problem is it uses NuSOAP which is not actively developed anymore.

      Last update to code was over 2 or 3 years ago.
