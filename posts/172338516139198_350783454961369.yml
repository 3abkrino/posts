  as we all know, you can't make cross-domain AJAX calls with jQuery, or any other alternative library.
  this is due to a concept called "same origin policy", and BTW this is a browser-level implementation, not with the technology that is being used.

  this plugin will fix this behavior in a VERY smart way, and will let you do this with ease.
  Give it a try, and let me know if you faced any problems.
  BTW, I've faced a problem when calling some Arabic content due to charset incompatibility, I've fixed this plugin to support Arabic and other non-Latin characters.

  I will post it and let you know soon ISA.
