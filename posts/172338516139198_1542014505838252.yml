message: hey everyone, i have a laptop lenovo z51-70 the i5 edition, i have a problem
  with it, when i tried to update the GPU AMD R9 m375 4GB, in the AMD center, when
  it downloaded the update and the update is installing, at half or almost in the
  end the laptop gave me a BSOD (i was eating and left it without using it at all
  and it was cool), so it restarted as normal and tried to start a game or reinstall
  the update, each time i try that it makes a BSOD with a different code, so i tried
  windows 8(i was using windows 10 since i got it for over a year), but the problem
  was as it is, so i took it to a shop to change the motherboard after i searched
  online and found a lot of people saying that the GPU may be burned, so the guy at
  the shop changed the motherboard 2 times and tried another RAM and HDD, but the
  problem persists, anyone has any idea to solve this.(i downloaded a patch of PES
  2017 and i think i got a virus, that's why i told the guy to try another HDD).
