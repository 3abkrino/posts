    message: Why do you even use MonoDevelop? If you're using if for Unity then you
      can use Visual Studio instead. Actually VS is now the new default for Unity
      on Windows :)

      I just checked, VS isn't the default, but Unity 5.2's installer will give you the option to install VS 2015 Community Edition instead of MonoDevelop.
      Anyways, just install this:
      https://www.visualstudio.com/features/unitytools-vs
      (press on "3 Free VS Tools for Unity")
      Of course you need to have VS already installed, if not, you can get VS 2015 Community Edition for free (same link, but second button instead)

      Why are you using 4.0? :D
      Unity 4.0 Free has very limited features, but starting with Unity 5 they made all engine features available in the free version (called personal edition), and they added a ton of more features like Physically-based Shading and real-time global illumination :)
