      Looks like it doesn't have.

      I made this google search:
      firebase built in sql "like"

      Which led me to this:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22506531/how-to-perform-sql-like-operation-on-firebase

      But I thought maybe it's 2014, a bit old, and then saw this:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38618953/how-to-do-a-simple-search-in-string-in-firebase-database
      and this:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39058119/firebase-database-requests-and-queries-like-sql-where-in

      Which confirmed the same thing.

      I think that's why you can't find anything about how to do it with Firebase itself, because it's not supported in the first place.
