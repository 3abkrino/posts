message: "Dears \n\nI have two applications one is written in Java and the other is
  written in Scala. \n\nThe java application is using the Scala application as a library.
  When I build the java application against JDK 1.8 every thing works fine. \n\nWhen
  the I build the application against JDK 1.7, the application throw the following
  exception.\n\njava.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: scala/collection/Seq : Unsupported
  major.minor version 52.0\n\nIt seems that the Scala application is compatible with
  JDK 1.8 only. \nI tried to change the project compiler settings in the Scala project
  and set the target JVM into version 1.7 but nothing changed. \n\nAny suggestions
  to have the application run against JDK 1.7 ?\nMaher Mohamed Gamal Ahmed Abdurrahman

    message: I think I solved the problem. The only Scala version installed on my
      machine is 2.11.6. The java application (which is maven application) contains
      dependency to another version of scala-library (usually I am putting the latest
      version I found in http://mvnrepository.com/) When I changed the version in
      the POM file to match the installed version on my machine every thing works
      fine :D :D
