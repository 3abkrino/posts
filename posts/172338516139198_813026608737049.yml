  i think that Apple Watch will be a huge success despite inheriting the same Apple products syndrome! (high price tag), but iPhone 6 is actually no big deal except being a copy of Koreans Sam or LG.

  BTW Apple proves every day that its identity built from two things which they done brilliantly, Industrial Design + Marketing.

    message: I think it's a backward step. People are abandoning watches for phones
      and Apple is reviving something from the past!!
