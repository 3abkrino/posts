      There is also Open Suse. I'm currently switching to it since I noticed a dramatic difference in resource utilization from Ubuntu Gnome 16.04
      What's nice about Open suse is that you can switch the desktop environment after you install the OS without breaking it. I remember I ran into a number of issue when I switch Ubuntu from Unity to Gnome (even though unity is based on Gnome) and I eventually installed the Gnome version of Ubuntu.
