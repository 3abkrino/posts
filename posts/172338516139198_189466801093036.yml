  Maybe it's old news for you, but I just knew about this amazing site today.

  it let's you write, and test scripts online with many of the known frameworks out there (jQuery, Extjs, MooTools, Prototype, YUI, Glow, Dojo,..,)and many more including pure JavaScript.

  has some more neat features:
  - it let's you add your own JS or CSS to test against
  - many examples to learn from
  - it can even test your ajax calls :)
