  SA,
  I started to learn how to make a bootloader a couple of days ago,everything was working fine till I reached the multi-stage bootloader,
  I made a single stage bootloader on a bootable ISO and it worked fine on VirtualBox but the problem is when I try to make a multi-stage bootloader (the boot sector is calling another bootloader in the same drive),it always gives me "INT18: boot failure" and after searching I found that I should change the boot order in VirtualBox but still the same problem.
  The boot signature is right,I am using nasm assembler,you can find the demo in this tutorial if you want to try it by yourself :

  In the demo "Boot1.bin" is calling "KRNLDR.SYS" just to print a string to the screen,He is using bochs emulator and a floppy for booting,I faced some problems with bochs so I decided to use VirtualBox and ISO instead,I am stuck with this problem so any help will be appreciated.
