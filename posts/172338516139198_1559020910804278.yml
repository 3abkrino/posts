  Dears,
  I'm passing a url in Java application to send a message to user's mobile phone, but when the message contains arabic characters it appears as question marks although inside the IDE it appears correctly,
  i've trying the encoding using 'UTF-8', but it doesn't work.
  any help please?
  Thanks.

      the problem. Are you using REST calls? Spring or vanilla EE?
