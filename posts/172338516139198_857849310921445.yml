  We are getting prepared to work on an app that needs the highest security possible.. what should we consider?
  Egyptian experience or not ?
  companies or individuals ?
  how much do you think it might cost ?

      The "highest security" is rather vague. Secure in what sense, be specific. Also provide some background about the app, if you're fishing for someone's experience in doing something you need to provide them with a context they might or might not relate to.

      Aside from that, a quick google search would do just fine.
