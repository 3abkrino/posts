message: "first of all I know that my question will seem ridiculous to some of you
  guys, but excuse my ignorance. \n\nMy home router is connected to a landline ..
  so I am wondering if it's possible to use some protocol or something to send signal
  and use it as a land line phone, is something like that possible ?"

      I used to do that at the good old days using 56k modems
