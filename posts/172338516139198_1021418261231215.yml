    message: "My own recommendations is to learn each one separately and then get
      any tutorial to show you how to get proper project structure. In udemy.com I
      recommend two courses as beginning, \"learn and understand nodejs\" & \"learn
      and understand angular\" both are very powerful and I recommend them personally
      over many other tutorial I found, both are focusing on understanding the technique
      and big words. Inside node course you will found intro to express and mongo.
      \nFor express and mongo tutorial I didn't try to look for them but I'm pretty
      sure you can find your way."
