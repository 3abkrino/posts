      No, I don't think you can, ACTION_PACKAGE_REMOVED broadcast will be sent to all other apps on your system except for your uninstalled app.
      Google Play though, does give you insights about the number of installed/uninstalled users.

    message: So the expected behavior is that once the user uninstalls the app, Chrome
      will suddenly open a web page? Do you think this is an acceptable behavior in
      the first place?

    message: Acceptability is not a matter of what you as a developer want to achieve.
      It is a matter of what users find acceptable. Personally, as an Android user,
      I would report an app that employs such invasive tactics.

      And why would a user waste his time on your survey especially after he wasted his time with your application ?
