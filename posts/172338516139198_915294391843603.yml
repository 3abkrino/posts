  Greetings...

  I'm using XAMPP package to simulate server-side codes in my localhost and I got a strange problem. Whenever I submit data using GET, they show up on the URL while I can't display the received data through "echo" function in PHP after checking that the data were set and they are not empty.

  I searched this problem in Google but It seems that I was not able to express it using the right words and the well-known troubles regarding form submission are not applicable to my case.

  Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated =)
