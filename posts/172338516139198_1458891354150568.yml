  #speech_recognition
  Does anyone understand the idea of tied states in HMM while training and can refere me to a clear explanation about it? I've seen someone who transformed states by hand and I just can't understand why ..
  Also what's called senones is it the same thing like number of leaves in a decision tree and if so what's a decision tree used for in speech recognition aren't we using hmm?!

      Hey, I have a very shallow understanding for speech recognition, however, this is an interesting project i stumbled up on several years ago, and there is an explanation about basic concepts of speech recognition. I think it explains what you are asking for. Hope it helps
