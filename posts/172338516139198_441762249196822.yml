    message: I use both, definitely it is not that important, JS compressors/minifiers
      and browser interpreters may do these similar optimization stuff for you if
      it really matters

    message: I usually use switch. It has a very slight performance gain over if statements.
      Please also take into consideration that it will depend on how you write the
      consecutive if statements; If you write consecutive if statements without using
      else, then the test will be executed in all cases while using switch will only
      evaluate the test once or in the worst case, it will stop upon finding the correct
      test.

      It will not make a difference if you use few case or your code is executed only a few times. Unless you put the conditional statements in a 100k loop :D.
