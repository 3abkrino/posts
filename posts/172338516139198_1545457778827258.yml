  SA,
  I've moved to a new place with no access to home phone and ADSL. I need to know wether it's worth it to buy a 4g router vs using mobile hotspot. What are the pros and cons? Also, I need recommendations for good 4g routers.

      (I doubt that would change with a separate router) but also some things like
      skype are blocked, because fuck net neutrality.

      A personal hotspot is not that reliable, it keeps failing to connect occasionally (both Android and iPhone), on iPhone it doesn't succeed without Bluetooth on (if you want Wifi connection), and can disconnect by itself from time to time (based on around 3 years of experience in Egypt and KSA).
      I didn't try a 4G router myself, but I suspect that it will be that unreliable

    message: "Personal hotspot is definitely a bad idea. \n\n1. It will keep draining
      your battery and eventually your battery will live a much shorter life. 2. You
      will notice how the hotspot keeps disconnecting whenever it is left unused for
      a short while. \n3. The internet will disconnect once you get a phone call.
      So if you are on the phone and someone asks you to check your email, you have
      to end the call.\n4. The wireless range for a mobile hotspot is probably very
      weak, yet another downside.\n\nNote: I got one of those Wifi USB from vodafone.
      I plug it in my laptop it works, plus the actual usb creates a wifi network
      itself. I have it plugged into a usb power plug and use a range extender to
      make sure it covers my entire home apartment. It can take around 10 devices
      I think."
