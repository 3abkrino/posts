    message: The chrome executable itself can take arguments. You can simply give
      it a url/filepath and it would open in a new tab if the browser was already
      open.

    message: Mohab Elkaref, does it mean that for each tab I need to start a new chrome
      process ?!

    message: Unfortunately, yes. Chrome treats every tab as it's own separate process,
      but they all have 1 parent process. You can verify that by opening the task
      manager and looking at the process tree. It's one of the many reasons why Chrome
      is such a memory hog.
