      Ruby on Rails has a market in Egypt. It has been a scarce skill that was hard to find for every Egyptian company that I know was interested in.

      You even can write the database queries in JavaScript & store your data as JSON documents with MongoDB. :)
      Now, with JavaScript you can be a full stack developer.
      I also recommend that give AngularJS a try.
      ===
      On another track, give some considerations for learning mobile development (Android or iOS).

      I can, but I know that's not your point. :-)
      There is limited demand, but supply is not enough. And the demand is growing.

      Besides, Ruby on Rails is worth learning even if you don't use it. It's the best Web framework that I have used until now, and I have used plenty. There is a lot to be learned from it.
