    message: If you're going to build a quality application then its best to use the
      native method for each platform and develop individually for the specific API's.
      Frameworks do the job easier but them you won't have a quality app.

      your skills, and not thinking in terms of "economical solution". You didn't

    message: "Going native or hybrid depends on several factors, for example \n\n--
      Are you doing this app(s) only to learn? \n-- Are these apps commercial? do
      you have strict delivery dates?\n-- Are you building performance-critical apps??
      Or it is just some forms and data entry? \n-- Do you already have some skills
      that you can reuse? Native dev skills? HTML, JS?\n\nIf you can answer these
      questions, I can help determine what might be best for you."
