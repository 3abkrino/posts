  Geeks, a while before I was ranting on about how I felt sad for my favourite Linux distro dying #!. I asked a question which I could not find a satisfying answer to:

  What makes a Linux Distro?

  As I now have a great resource for this I would like to share:

  This is the new #! ++ distro configuration files, I am personally looking around and understanding how things work. I can see files with package lists mainly and scripts for user inititaization plus themes, icons and other UI stuff.

  I thought I would share with those who want to see a Linux distro being created live
