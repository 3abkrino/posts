      what exactly you wanna discuss?
      are you trying to have a quick look over the most common PC specs for developers nowadays?, or wanna build the ultimate developer PC?

      my personal recommendations:
      1- go dual displays: you will never imagine it's benefits unless you give it a try, I've been working with dual monitors for around 6 years, and I can tell you that it's a better & different experience.
      2- Use SSD for boot drive, normal HD as storage: SSD drives are more affordable now and gives a punch in the face when talking about the speed. everything feels smooth and speedy when loaded from SSD.
      3- larger RAM is always better: never start below 6 GB, and better to start at 8, then go for 12GB when needed, personally I'm working with 8GB and most of the time I find that I'm utilizing around 60~80% of it, so it worth the money spent. note that when everything is served from the memory instead of the swap file (even if you are using SDD) the overall responsiveness of your computer will be increased significantly.
      4- a large case, well-designed, and with good air-flow will make your life easier. when expanding or working inside, you will have enough space to work on, and of course the temperature of your components will stay in safe margins.

    message: my current specs are not up to date with the latest hardware available,
      for example, i'm using an Intel 9550 2.83GHZ 12MB cache with 8GB DDR2 1066MHZ,
      so my current specs will not be available as of today, but let me know what
      is the best that you could find, and I will try to give you a good advice about
      it.

    message: There is no one right answer. In my company developers have several machines.
      Some have MacbookPro, some have Lenovo ThinkPad, some have Sony laptops, and
      some have ASUS or some less known brand like Origin PC (a laptop brand). Maybe
      we can agree on some minimum requirements.

    message: For example, a typical developer will find it very hard to work on a
      machine with less than 4 GB RAM, maybe 6 or 8 GB will be enough, considering
      a Virtual Machine or something, maybe 12 GB or 16 GB. Differences like DDR3
      1333 or DDR3 1600 don't make a big difference.

    message: Also for CPU, I have seen developers using i3 CPUs but they were suffering.
      I think i5 should enough though. i7 is of course nicer. Minimum usable speed
      would be 1.6 GHz for example, ideally you want something with 2+ GHz. I'm not
      sure how much of a difference will a 2.6GHz be compared to a 2.3GHz CPU for
      example, except if it has more L3 cache, this is also nice

    message: And of course, an SSD is the one thing you don't want to miss in your
      machine. At the very least a 7500RPM HDD if you can't get an SSD, but it "won't"
      be as nice.
