message: "ok this is out of IT but it's really important if you are living abroad
  ... \nmany people if they see you stressed out they will just tell you: \n\"Why
  you don't do Yoga\" and they start explaining how useful it is and how it makes
  you relax Bla Bla Bla... \n\nDON'T DO IT and I will tell you why. Because Simply
  Yoga is \"Buddhist Prayer\" i'm not giving a Fatwa here :) but it's useful to know
  and you can ask a Shikh if you need a Fatwa :)"
