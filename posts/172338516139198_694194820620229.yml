  We have a database server running SQL Server 2012 & another server which is the web-server running IIS8 hsting MVC 4 web-application & we are using EntityFramework  6.0
  My question is does SQL server have the option to compress query result set(in DB Server) while giving it back to EntityFramework(In Web Server) ?
  And if yes there is an option for that, how to configure it ?
