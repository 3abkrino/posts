  I am conducting a survey about the best BOT framework to use for a commercial application and I would like to to consult you if you already have an experience in this field.
  Basically, the framework should be easy to use and support many programming languages and integration with popular services such as Facebook, Microsoft ...

  Also, it should have a designer to build the workflow. I had a look at MS Bot framework but it is all about coding, no designer.
  There is a framework called Aspect, but i cannot figure out how it works and what programming languages it supports.

  Your help is highly appreciated
