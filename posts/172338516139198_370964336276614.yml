    message: what i need is to store an id along with an URL that the user can't just
      clear it from cookies or local storage. :S this has to be done Client side!
      or if there is a way to save these info in the user google account?!

    message: in the client side there is no way that you can protect from changing
      or removing , you can save it in server side and access the user google account
      via OAuth
