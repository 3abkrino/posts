      you are taking the system view of communication course?:)
      I didn't figure it out yet, but mostly is line: tx_bs = [byte];replaces the entire vector with the array, it should add it to the end instead

    message: yes i'm , you almost there the wrong was with it and the correct is tx_bs
      = [tx_bs , byte];  for not overwriting the characters

    message: programming is programming after all, if you are good with any other
      language you should be able to figure your way around matlab in no time, getting
      used to the syntax is the laborious part.
