    message: well, Nexmo 50c/sms is expensive among others. actually i tried many
      and the best i found is smsglobal(~30c/sms) and smsmisr.net(~20c/sms) they are
      both fine and instant regardless the awful homepage design for the Egyptian
      company but the profile management is bootstrap-based and somehow modern.
