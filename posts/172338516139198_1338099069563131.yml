message: anyone with experience of displaying 360 photos in web apps, my app is built
  with angular2, n i'll probably need to build a custom component for that, so, right
  now, i'm just looking for the best library someone used before to display 360 photos
  in a web app n it didn't downgrade the overall performance of the page, i also need
  something lightweight..
