      I remember reading that there is something you have to do with your DNS record so mail servers can verify that the message is not spam.
      I did a quick search and found this:
      http://kb.kerio.com/product/kerio-connect/server-configuration/mail-delivery-and-dns-records/essential-dns-records-for-mail-delivery-and-spam-protection-1223.html
      It's for a certain mail server product, but it might be useful in your case too.

      Of course you can throw away all that and use things like SendGrid like Mohamed Essam suggested :)
