  Interesting new unofficial train info app.
  Hard to compare with the official Metro app screenshot.

  Interestingly, a lot of people who could afford an iPhone are like shocked that the iPhone version is paid! Will be interesting to see how well the app goes financially for other entrepreneurs to learn from its story

    message: The paid part I find weird not because they shouldn't sell it for money
      but because it's paid on iOS but free on Android. Why? Genuine question. It's
      a $0.99, it's not like you have to have an iPhone/be able to afford an iPhone
      to afford it.

    message: will be great if they add users' feedback + GPS location about the expected
      arrival time for each train in each station (I mean when the train is late then
      the official time - and it's a lot-, so anyone waiting for the train can know
      the expected real arrival time)
