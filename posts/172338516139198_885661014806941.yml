message: "Help needed! \n\nOn iOS or Android is there a way to create push notifications
  that have a custom view (i.e. custom actions like Download Update, Confirm...etc.)
  And i need to push these notification to users on certain times they can be local
  notifications or pushed from internet the important thing is that i can get the
  custom view even if the app is closed.\n\nAny idea how?"
