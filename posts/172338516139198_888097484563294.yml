message: "Dear Geeks, I need you to help me with this dillema:\n\nI am  officially
  addicted to #Crunchbang I am absolutely compelled to make it my main OS. Should
  I keep it as a VM? Any ideas? thoughts?\n\nAdvantages of VM:\n\n1. Small \n2. Transferable\n3.
  Will contain all my software and configurations\n4. I have enough RAM to offer it
  great performance.\n5. Ubuntu only takes 450 MB when it starts anyway, so starting
  \ #! in VM is negligible in performance difference than if I started it native.\n6.
  A 10 GB VM contains all my software  and learning needs. Easily transferable via
  USB and can just be ready to start again on any machine.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n1.
  It feels more organic just to boot it as main OS.\n2. It consumes few resources
  so I can use it as my VM host. (150 MB at start)\n3. It will relax my OCD tendencies
  to make it a full install.\n4. Full install won't be transferable.\n5. The lack
  of visual candy is relaxing to my brain, I actually feel so much better without
  it.\n\nAnyway, please share your thoughts with me, this is one of the few times
  in my life that I can't make a clear decision an it's killing me."

      running LMDE for 3 years,arch for 2 years, Ubuntu for 3 years

      if you want to isolate your work from your computer use crashbang and use vagrent for development on it.

      so I guess I have the two options ready .. the annoying thing is that the hard

      Anybody else cannot find the problem here? :D
      It's depends on how long you will use CB? It's not big deal to install any distro when you decided to move from one to other. So what's previous distro? Ubuntu? Fedora? I think you will not find any problem when you go with CB.

      IMHO, VMs stay VMs, so go with full OS, and may you like to use the same /home with multi distros.

      Aha, I see :D
      Ok, If I won't go anywhere (Should I? :DD) and I have sufficient space on my disk, I will install CB alongside Ubuntu, and leave Ubuntu as it. I'm not fan of VMs for daily use at all :â€‘)

      always have on unusable partition. Why not a VM daily? If I can give it 8 -10
      GB RAM or even more, and it only uses 2 GB full load anyway? And with an SSD
      and #! resource handling I feel absolutely no difference, actually #! VM is
      faster cause it is just a Window manager and no eyecandy. I browse the web,
      write code.  Email is a web client. I play games on host OS, Ubuntu and basically
      Open Arena only. I am also interested in EMACS and if you know that is a bother
      to configure, you basically need an PHD. So after I get everything up to scratch
      and stable, if the HD dies or I want to move to another device for any reason,
      I just copy a VM file. The VM is already maximum resolution.  The only issue
      is if I wanna set it up to program cuda cores.'

      about the 3 minutes you boot, login, then boot the VM, and the other 30 seconds
      you close VM, shutdown computer? \n\nIf so, have you considered looking for
      ways to boot directly from the VM. One way is to place it on an external drive/usb
      \ http://www.howtogeek.com/97923/how-to-boot-a-vmware-virtual-machine-from-a-usb-drive/
      . I have seen people do this using VMware Server, but that would be an overkill
      in your case.\n\nAnother silly suggestion would be to setup a windows user that
      loads the VM on startup, and set that user to auto-login. So basically, if you
      open your computer and went to grab a bottle of water, when you are back you
      have your fullscreen VM running."
