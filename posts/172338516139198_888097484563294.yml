message: "Dear Geeks, I need you to help me with this dillema:\n\nI am  officially
  addicted to #Crunchbang I am absolutely compelled to make it my main OS. Should
  I keep it as a VM? Any ideas? thoughts?\n\nAdvantages of VM:\n\n1. Small \n2. Transferable\n3.
  Will contain all my software and configurations\n4. I have enough RAM to offer it
  great performance.\n5. Ubuntu only takes 450 MB when it starts anyway, so starting
  \ #! in VM is negligible in performance difference than if I started it native.\n6.
  A 10 GB VM contains all my software  and learning needs. Easily transferable via
  USB and can just be ready to start again on any machine.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n1.
  It feels more organic just to boot it as main OS.\n2. It consumes few resources
  so I can use it as my VM host. (150 MB at start)\n3. It will relax my OCD tendencies
  to make it a full install.\n4. Full install won't be transferable.\n5. The lack
  of visual candy is relaxing to my brain, I actually feel so much better without
  it.\n\nAnyway, please share your thoughts with me, this is one of the few times
  in my life that I can't make a clear decision an it's killing me."
