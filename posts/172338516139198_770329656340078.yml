  Any .Net developer here experienced in Cryptography?
  I'm looking for a great Cryptography library because the built in functionality in .Net is limited, for example: the BCL's implementation of PBKDF2 uses HMAC-SHA1 and I need one that uses HMAC-SHA512.
  I've been searching for some time now and found a few options but the most significant ones are CryptSharp and BouncyCastle.
  So I which of these is better? do you have a better recommendation?

      Mohamed Meligy: I know that there is a class for HMAC-SHA512, but that's just hashing (with a key), what I'm looking for is PBKDF2 (key derivation function) that uses HMAC-SHA512 internally, the PBKDF2 implementation in the BCL is called "Rfc2898DeriveBytes" and it uses HMAC-SHA1 internally.
      I've seen some implementations of PBKDF2 that accepts any HMAC algorithm on Stackoverflow and Blogs, but I don't know if I could trust them, small mistakes can cause disasters when it comes to security :\
