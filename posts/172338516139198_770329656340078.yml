  Any .Net developer here experienced in Cryptography?
  I'm looking for a great Cryptography library because the built in functionality in .Net is limited, for example: the BCL's implementation of PBKDF2 uses HMAC-SHA1 and I need one that uses HMAC-SHA512.
  I've been searching for some time now and found a few options but the most significant ones are CryptSharp and BouncyCastle.
  So I which of these is better? do you have a better recommendation?
