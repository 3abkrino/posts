message: "Dears,\n\nWe would like to introduce to you ZABTNY\n\nIt is the first Egyptian
  social media platform. It is not a dating website the name is just unique  :)\n\nWe
  are trying to create a platform aimed to residents of Egypt, to help in adding value
  to their lives and not just waste their time. There are a couple of new feature
  which we are sure would interest you, like \n\n-Marketplace: Where you can see and
  buy anything.\n\n-Forums: Where you can share a subject with the website members.\n\n-Your
  very own Business Profile: Where you can post daily updates about your job.\n\n-Private
  notes: Where you can write notes for yourself in a customized way.\n\nI would like
  to personally invite you to this platform, Facebook page link: https://www.facebook.com/zabtny.comEgypt
  \n\nWe look forward to hearing from you :)\n\n*We am really sorry if you felt uncomfortable
  with such approach, but we are doing our best to be selective with our users and
  it would be our honor to have you all as members on our website."
