    message: Mohamed Alaa El Din created the group. He invited his old colleagues
      from SilverKey Technologies who were now working in several different countries
      (including Egypt still), and we were encouraged to add other people we recognized
      as trusted gurus, all to be admins. The mix was quite unique compared to other
      technical groups on facebook, and so was the content shared.

    message: Eventually new members became regular members and admins, and the bar
      is staying as high as we can keep it although we don't prevent people like students
      etc to come in and those sometimes have, well, different topics and questions,
      because you never know who's going to,be great asset (some students like Eslam
      Hamouda are very valuable for example), and we also try to be more open than
      conservative.

    message: "Hi أنس موسى \n\nThe reason of this group is mainly to share our knowledge
      we are a bunch of geeks who used to work together back in Egypt and we have
      a lot of fun and a lot of sharing information between us.\n\nWe used to have
      a Yahoo Group (Only SilverKey Guys remember these days) and Mohamed Elsherif
      Has Ask Developer Podcast Domain and we wanted to do something. then he moved
      to Microsoft, Mohamed Meligy Moved to Emirates then to Australia and wanted
      to keep the same group/attitude active. I started the Group with the help of
      all the SK People and we started to share our knowledge between us and sharing
      interesting links and information. \n\nThen we started to accept and invite
      close people who we know and they are interesting in the same type of information.\n\nMohamed
      Elsherif Also Started the Egyptian Geek Hangout we try to be different in our
      activities as we don't find any other Arabic source to help Developers or Students
      in Egypt.\n\nWe always try to keep the quality of the Group, Help Each others
      and Most important Connecting Geeks in a clean way without SPAM or Ads.\n\nI
      would also be more than happy to answer any question you might have.\n\nAnd
      welcome to our Group.\nMohamed."

      value people participation in our little community :) So you are more than welcome
      to prove you deserve to be an Admin. :)

      We have a flat structure. Admins are people who help keeping up the community, making sure we maintain the same quality and most important fighting spam once in a while. So the right answer is:

      Everyone knows what he has to do there is no Super Duper Admin :) If you are and admin you want to get the best out of the community so you will do all your best to keep the community running in the right direction.
