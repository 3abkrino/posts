  I want a good library for reading bar code using windows phone app. especially Code 128 and Code 39.
  I tried many open source libraries but non of them was reliable.
  So if you have personal experience with any library doing this please mention it.

      No sure If you have tried it or not, but I've used ZXing in my Android applications and it worked great (at least for  EAN_128 didn't try with Code 39 ).

      It has bindings for several languages one of them is for the .NET platform.
