  I'm a web developer who works mainly on PHP projects. I'm gonna have a lot of spare time ahead and I want to learn a new language or improve myself in the ones i know, Could you suggest me what to do ? Here's what's in my head:

  1. Learn JavaScript design patterns
  2. Learn Python then Django (I have a background in Python)
  3. Learn C++ (I had a background a while ago)
  4. ?
