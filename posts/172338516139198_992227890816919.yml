message: I'm writing a custom CISC CPU core in Verilog for SoC design. Unfortunately,
  the current FPGA device I'm using (Altera EP4CE6) doesn't containt sufficient BRAM
  (270 Kbits) for storing the microcode ROM table. Is there any method for optimizing
  the microcode ROM without depending mainly on BRAM?
