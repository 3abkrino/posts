  Dear Geeks,

  I just need your opinion about something. Do you prefer to work with a project manager that has technical knowledge or one of those "business only" people who wouldn't know how to write a Hello World program and why?

  I am asking this cause I have had good/bad experiences with both and wonder if it is just me or do other people have the same experiences as me?
