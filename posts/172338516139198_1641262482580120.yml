  Greetings,

  As I posted before, it seems Skype is blocked on 4G and now it’s blocked by TEData as well. I get an error message “Skype can’t connect” whenever I try to login. I contacted Microsoft/Skype customer support and they confirmed the reason (after 2 hours) is blocking by the ISPs. So my question is, are there other services I can use for low-cost international calling and videoconference? Does Viber or Google Hangouts work for int’l calling from Egypt? It needs to work on Windows 10 and has an iOS app preferably

  Many thanks in advance

      like Skype. And which’s better, Hangouts or Viber? \n\nMany thanks"

      Get a real ip on your internet subscription
      Or keep rebooting your router until you connect to subnet not blocked by NTRA
