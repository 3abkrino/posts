      When I was a student, several students took the CCNA certificates and were very happy with them. Consider looking at the certificate materials and studying in general whether you decide to take the certificate or not.

      If you prefer courses, since this is a popular path, it should be easy to find training centers that can give you the certificate course(s) as well.

    message: there's another course called CompTIA Network+, I highly recommend this
      one as it will explain all the basics of networking away from any vendor based
      course/certification like CCNA

    message: Start by learning Linux, choose an OS that is parent to make others such
      as Open Suse or Debian (my favourite). Then do a Linux networking course such
