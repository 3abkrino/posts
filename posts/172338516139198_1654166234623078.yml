  Hellow Awesome ppl,

  Suppose that u have a search engine:

  - You search for "Red Ferrari"

  - The query will be "Red AND Ferrari"

  - This query ^^ returned Zero results

  - Then you fallback to "Red OR Ferrari" query, which can get search results like:
    - Red carpet
    - Red pen
    - Green Ferrari

  From business perspective, what is better: to show zero results (stick with the AND query), or show many results that can be irrelevant (using OR query)

      we send 2 search queries in the same request that will be sent to Elastic:\n1-
      an \"And\" query, with boost (weight) of 2\n2- an \"Or\" query, with no specified
      boosting (weight) (which defaults to 1) \n\nthis way, when we have both terms
      they gonna be the top results, then followed by the (or) ones. and in the case
      of no records for the (and) query, we will still return some relevant results
      assuming the (or) query has some results returned."

      Guys, maybe I was not clear enough .. My point is, all of these approaches gonna fulfil the goal of getting search results:

      My point is that we have two options:
      - Get accurate, relevant search results.
      - Use OR: there you will "never" guarantee the relevancy and accuracy of the results.

      Given these trade-offs *from business POV, forget about the technical aspect* .. what will be the best ?
