  The How Old website, release by Microsoft (http://how-old.net) offers a seemingly simple service: upload a picture of a person and it will guess their age.

  Linked in the same page, an interesting blog post about how they achived this (http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2015/04/29/fun-with-ml-stream-analytics-and-powerbi-observing-virality-in-real-time.aspx).

  TLDR; the whole thing is based on Microsoft face detection and comparison API (http://www.projectoxford.ai/demo/face)
