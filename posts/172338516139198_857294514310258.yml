  "Git" gurus, could you please help me in something

  As far as I know, Git access could be manipulated through server user/group authentication. but is there is any way that I can use another access authentication regardless the OS server authentication?

      Mohamed Meligy I wish :D . I am in a company that supports open source; to the core. but it would be very good for me  though :)

      I think I am gonna use gitolite, the free un-user-friendly solution ;)

    message: i came through it, but I didn't figure how the developers will commit
      through eclipse or through its GUI. Committing through command line is a bigger
      headache. that is why I want to use gitolite over gitlab or Gitblit

      Actually Gitlab is awesome. Thanks Araby for mentioning (I forgot all about it although a colleague blogged about it a few years ago).

      It's just a virtual machine that contains git and preinstalled web UI to manage it.

      The nature of the git server doesn't dictate how the developers commit/push. Even if it uses SSH, there are UI clients on Windows and Mac (GitExtensions comes with putty integrated by default and Source Tree has it built in its own UI, Eclipse sure can do something too)
