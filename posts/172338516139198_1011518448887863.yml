  I'm sure you guys heard about the new iOS 9 ad blocking.

  So the way ad blocking will work on iOS 9 is that the ad blocking software will detect where requests are being made to and if it's identified as from a known ad server, it blocks it.
  There's a massive opportunity for someone to develop a more distributed kind of ad server that allows to serve ads from a bigger network of servers, or even make a self hosted version that will allow anyone to easily host their own (openx and similar servers aren't for your average user at all).
  Think about it and I'd be v interested to figure out how we can develop something like this.
  In case you think ads are evil, well they basically power up most of the internet.
