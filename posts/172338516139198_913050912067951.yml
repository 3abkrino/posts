  I am going to write few front end tests for a webapp that's widely used, and I am now in the problem of choosing a service.

  I have settled on 3 options and I am abit confused.

  1- two of the testing frameworks are almost developerless, you record the action and the service make it as a test case and it tests it for you on various devices and browsers.

  2- The other option is Casper.js "Which will need a separate server and to integrate with CI tools" and it tests with webkit and gecko on various screen sizes.

  I want to ask about the benefits I get If I made the self coded/hosted frontend testing, anyone tried one of these paid services?
  Can someone recommend something he's really comfortable with ?
