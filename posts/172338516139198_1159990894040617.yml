    message: Why not, Laptop that's designed by different companies can work with
      any OS. I don't know why wouldn't that happen for Mobile. The best OS for mobile
      in my opinion is Chrome OS, it would be perfect.

    message: Well, Apple and Android will continue to fight for a larger market share
      but i think both will continue to be present unless JAVA and OBJECTIVE-C are
      deprecated and replaced with 1 superior programming language. and even if that
      happened both companies will develop their own OS based on it and market it
      as the better OS for your Phone. so in short NO.

    message: There should be a company that comes up and challenge that. It would
      gain a lot of shares and support for its flexibility that same as Windows.
