  Iam using WordPress 4.0.1 , want to move a page i created to work on a subdomain ,
  i tried using those plugins,
  https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-subdomains-revisited/
  https://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-subdomains/
  https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-subdomains/other_notes/

  None of them worked , i find myself in 404 page when i visit the subdomain , (( i am sure that i followed the installation instructions in each plugin ))

  any ideas?

      did you added a wildcard record in the DNS zone  file to map to the website directory correctly ?
      *this is a must for the second plugin.
