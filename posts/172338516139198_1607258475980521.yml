  Hello geeks,
  this question is mainly about computer vision, so I'm trying to detect handwritten alpha-numerics in images, I've looked around and found that there is an already trained neural network using tensorflow on the SVHN (The Street View House Numbers) dataset, I'm trying to achieve a similar thing but with handwritten alpha-numerics, can that be done ? also if I will be training some neural network for that, what dataset can you recommend, I managed to find EMNIST which is an extension to MNIST but with alphabets, yet I think it won't be useful as it contains digits&characters isolated and not annotated within scenes.
  your help is appreciated.
