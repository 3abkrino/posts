    message: Basically you defer the whole process to a 3rd party payment gateway.
      Some will require to have their own pages with particular styling and give you
      some control over the styles, some will allow you to render the form and submit
      to them, in all cases, you MUST not store credit card data (no, don't think
      about encrypting it or whatever, there're horrible legal issues to deal with
      if you do -at least in many countries-, and trust me, you won't implement it
      right the first or 5th time). You'll also need an SSL certificate to use for
      the payment form.

    message: I don't know which payment gateways support paying to Egyptian bank accounts
      (or credit cards). This may be an OK starrt http://www.wamda.com/2013/02/payment-gateways-in-the-arab-world-2013-infographic

    message: If it's a big organization, talk to STC. If it's like UAE, most gov,
      semi-gov, and big organizations will use the biggest telco company as their
      payment processor.

      requires to gather fees from online customers, most of the payment gateway that

      is suitable for the project.

    message: Maybe consider Paypal for beginning, or Google Checkout, or Stripe (that's
      what Tekpub used) or BrainTree (used in Tekpub sample as well).
