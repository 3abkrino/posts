  Hi geeks, anyone uses a db2db sync in his web app that allows him to work fully offline and sync when he got connection , from react, cordova or even any web technology "client side only".

  Do you think couchdb/pouchdb stable for production in the level of 1m request a day.

      perfect \U0001F44C\U0001F3FB, our target load was 10M users with average 5 requests
      per day.\n\nFrom Backend perspective, it is very scalable also, you can add
      as many nodes to the cluster as needed!"
