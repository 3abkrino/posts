    message: For large scale apps, you should have a business rules engine "BRE" that
      comes with a UI suitable for your client needs. The app business logic will
      be dependent on these configurable rules. Your customer uses the UI to change
      the rules ---> the app behavior changes to reflect their changes.

    message: If it is small scale and just some configurable parameters, probably
      you can just create a simple UI for your client to configure some DB-persistent
      parameters. In the business logic, use these parameters to change the behavior.

    message: That's a pretty broad and vague requirements, I would urge asking for
      more specific examples on what are the types of business rules that are open
      for customers to specify.

      :)
      my customer have some of payment methods on his eCommerce site but each payment method requires some rules to be applied.
      like product that have price greater than 3000$ can't have payment method x
      product that have weight greater than 30 KG  can't have free deliver fees
      Also he can do combination of 2 or 3 rules to create new rule. and so on

    message: That sounds way more simpler than the original request :) at least it
      is scoped to payment system, how open the rules are, and how often they may
      change, if these rules are fixed (except for some values like weights and stuff)
      that could be even simpler
