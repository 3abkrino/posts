message: "SA,\nDoes anyone have experience with LDAP (especially ldapjs) ?\nI have
  noticed that the ldap server disconnects every x minutes, so I provided \"reconnect\"
  option to the client, and subscribed to the client's error handler.\nNow the client
  reconnects to the server whenever it disconnects.\nIs that good programming practice?
  Are there any alternatives? \nThanks in advance."

    message: The fact that it disconnects every few minutes is an indication that
      there is deeper problem, which shouldn't be ignored. You provided a temporary
      solution to carry you over until you figure out the problem, but it absolutely
      should not be your final solution.
