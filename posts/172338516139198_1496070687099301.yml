message: "What is the best and why?? \nStack by array or by list or by linkedlist\n1-
  stack by array is fixed size but by list and linkedlist is dynamic size\n2- stack
  by linkedlist o(n) always = 1 for push operation\nBut for list o(n) = n if count
  = capacity \n#####################\nSo what about memory size and performance for
  stack by linkedist VS stack by list ??"

    message: In embedded software usually its better to use array, usually there is
      no operating system involved so a dynamic heap is hard to get, otherwise in
      normal the dynamic stack is usually used.
