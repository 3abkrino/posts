message: "Hello,\n\nI have a problem, a few months ago i decided to teach myself web
  development, I'm in computer engineering so it would help, i (almost) finished FreeCodeAcademy's
  course, which was a really good course using javascript and the MEAN stack, but
  i am kind of in a wall here, i don't know what to do next? Am i ready for a junior
  job, should i keep studying? From where? \n\nWeb development, specially javascript,
  have so many frameworks it's confusing. :D"

      JQuery and then learn a backend language such as Java.

      You should study first html and CSS, practice what you studied, you should download many free samples and see the best practice for doing all tips and tricks. Java script is the next level, starting with advanced level is not the best choice often :D .. why I'm saying that?!
      Cuz I'm communication engineer :D

    message: I have already studied html and css, quite more than javascript too,i
      am not an expert on them i assume but i have quite a few projects with them,
      i also studied jquery and native javascript and worked with backend languages
      like Node.js and PHP with laravel, i'm just not very sure about when you can
      call yourself good enough for a junior job, if that is the gateway to getting
      better, i'm also trying to build some projects in my free time. :D

      You should be up to an entry level position from what you described. If you
      want a MS shop, then learn ASP.NET MVC basics, Java, learn SPRING. I suggest
      Java.

    message: Maybe pick a framework or language you'd like to learn and start a project
      with it, also you can contribute to open source, to learn how to work with other
      people's code in large codebases.

    message: I suggest to derive your effort from your goals. For example if your
      goal is to land a job, then start analyzing the job market where your hunting
      for the required skills and work on them. What I want to emphasize is to be
      able to trace what you do to what you want to get at the end. The result of
      this is not losing sight and feeling lost and not knowing what to do next. This
      exercise should help you to get a long prioritized TO-DO list. Do not complicate
      things, just a very simple process (a few hours) will get you the plan to where
      you want to get. And please revise your plan after each milestone - as you get
      more knowledge and the world changes you would need to adapt. All the best!

      My case was starting with android and it shouldn't be different from your case,  I have began with an online course, then built a couple of projects to practice, then a couple of freelancing projects, then an internship then got hired
      Speaking from that experience, the internship was the breakthrough point
      I would highly suggest you look for an internship and make the most out of it!
