  An unfortunate event happened to my girlfriend this week, they scammed her for DKK 400. Upon inspection, it turns out it was a dark pattern.

  The service offered a 14 days trial for £1. No where on their website do they mention a monthly subscription fee and for how much. No where on their website do they link to a pricing page.

  But get this, it's actually mentioned in their terms of service...  http://jukebux.com/terms.php?lang=uk clause 4

  It's a rare occasion for an average joe computer user to read the terms of service and those who do, rarely understand it.

  So they get your credit card on system, charge you £1. You agreed to the terms of service likely without reading it, TOS mention a EUR/GBP 50 charge upon the trial ending and next thing, you're wondering what happened to your money.

  Anyway, that's that. Jukebux, a dark patterns embracer. There's a much more deeper plot behind what actually happened, how they scammed her into getting an account (She didn't knowingly know she was signing up for a Jukebux account) I'm still investigating how this happened.

  Lesson:
  **Read The Terms Of Service**
