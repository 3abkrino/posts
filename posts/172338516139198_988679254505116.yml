    message: If you are really looking for peoples' opinion, at least post the specs  of
      those laptops so we can compare. It is very unlikely that people will spend
      half an hour googling the specs and making comparisons on their own.

      Satellite for 5 years, it gets very VERY hot, also I think any Toshiba laptop
      is overpriced \n\nafterwards I bought a new Asus, it has a touchscreen, and
      since I am using Linux, I find some display issues, also it comes with Windows
      8, and the default color configuration is very hot, by hot I mean the I feel
      everything is getting red,\n\nAnd about dell, I didn't have one before, but
      my friends say it gets very hot too"

      The Dell has a U processor, so I would personally steer away from it. The 5700HQ and the 4720HQ are nearly identical, so I would go with Toshiba, the SSD gives it an edge.

      Another point to put into consideration is the size and weight of the laptop. Good luck.

    message: Apparently you want a laptop for gaming, so you should go with MSI. You
      can check the reviews on the internet.
