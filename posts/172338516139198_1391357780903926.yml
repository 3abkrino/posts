message: "Im in a real bad situation !!!\n\nOne of our solutions -a part of it- is
  a secret , we don't have any copy of out of MY OLD LAPTOP.\nI was looking back to
  it 2 days ago and i found some stupid virus inside all Javascript files !!!!\n\nWhen
  you try to publish it , and as soon as its published  you open the dist folder and
  the antivirus deletes all JavaScript files.\n\nANY HELP !!!\n\nUpdate \n1- we should
  include this module on a client solution next week , we built our plan as if this
  is ready !\n2- Im afraid to move the solution for other PCs inside the company ,
  i tried Windows Defender and AVG on the old laptop , should i try another antivirus
  on  that laptop ?\n3- Does Git repositories check for Maleware, if i pushed it to
  github will it check for maleware , i think it might be an exe file or the IDE on
  the laptop that injects something in the published version !!!\n\nP.S. I need to
  make sure the solution is clean before moving it into another PC inside the company
  network."

    message: i dont think you can upload a file of those javascript to an online repo
      , hmm you can use boxjs to analyse the issue and remove manually , the message
      is insanely unhelpful !!!
