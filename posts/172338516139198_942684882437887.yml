message: "Hello every one,\nI was working on an angularJS, IONIC project with CI backend\nI
  was sending parameters to server using POST Method. and receive it using codeIgniter
  Input class. and everything was working OK.\n\nNow that app gonna be native Android
  and the developer should send parameters as JSON array, so i changed my backend
  API function to receive it like:\n\n$data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'),
  true);\n$email = $data->email;\n\nIt works great but the problem now when i try
  to access the function using IONIC app I get an php error.\n \nI'm searching around
  that and found a solution to post parameters as json array but it gives me an error:\n\nXMLHttpRequest
  cannot load http://192.168.1.122/project/index.php/api/login. Request header field
  Content-Type is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers.\n\non my API I allowed
  all CORS\n\nheader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');\nheader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods:
  POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, PUT');\n\nbut still get the same error.\n\ncan i get
  any other solution around that point.\nthanks for your help."

      You're not even setting Access-Control-Allow-Headers. You need to set it correctly.

      Additionally, check that out before adding it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13146892/cors-access-control-allow-headers-wildcard-being-ignored

      It doesn't accept wildcards.

      Basically, add that.

      Access-Control-Allow-Headers: origin, content-type, x-requested-with, accept
