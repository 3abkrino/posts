  i am working on a writing a small tool written in Go, that is supposed to generate dummy data for mongodb using Go. i am not sure if something like this has been made before.

  what i am doing is making use of Go structs, take a struct("which is supposed to be a placeholder for a mongodb docc") and convert it to a map, then start inserting dummy data into the db collection.

  right now, i am now sure what is the proper way to populate strings, any idea ?

  and do you think it is useful to write such a tool ?
