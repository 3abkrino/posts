    message: It's possible but in many scenarios it requires a physical access to
      the victim's device.

      web code through remotely connected computer application you will have a live
      stream of his messages incoming and old ones, peace ✌️ out

    message: I don't think this would happen or be easy after adding end to end encryption
      keys for each conversation, also they added a new security feature "two step
      verification" to be requested when you register ur num with wtsapp again.
