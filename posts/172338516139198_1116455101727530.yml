  bash\" and porting the bash!"

      isn't git bash basically an MSYS?
      this is not new, MS always had POSIX support in Windows but it was out of date and they dropped the ball on updating it.

      I think the new bash is just MSYS but built into windows, plus some of the SUS4 APIs and apps (Single Unix Spec v4)

      The whole trick is to keeping it up to date in the future, else it will be just as useless in 2 years time.

      Plus the Linux Kernel is a big beast of its own, without it the Linux experience will never be complete.

      guys, there is a big difference between things like Cygwin and what they're doing now.
      What they're doing now it making all of Ubuntu run on top of the Windows NT kernel instead of the Linux kernel, they wrote a thin layer to convert calls to the Linux kernel to calls to the NT kernel.
      You can actually run apt-get now and install the ruby and python builds that are targeted for Linux :)
