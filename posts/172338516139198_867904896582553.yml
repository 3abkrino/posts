      Don't be too emotionally attached to the idea.

      If the idea exists, this is almost always a good thing. It provides market validation. It tells you that people are willing to pay for it.

      If you come up with an idea that no one tried before, it's more likely that others found it bad rather than that you are the first person ever to come up with it.

      That leads me to the opening statement. You'll learn a lot of thing building what the idea is about. It may succeed and you'll learn more, and you might apply the learning to other ideas afterwards.

      It may fail, and then you'll also apply the learning to another idea and try again. You've already learned something about market validation and fear of other ideas by reading these comments.
