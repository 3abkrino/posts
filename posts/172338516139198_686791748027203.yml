    message: The question is not about comparing Rails or Node.  The question is about
      how he made the transition,  especially as a designer,  not a dev-savvy person.

    message: "Thanks a lot guys I just saw the post now as I was traveling to the
      Capital of Mexico to fix some stuff with the Government for one of the projects
      i'm working on. \n\nI would love To make it a podcast explaining how i made
      the transition, the motives and Yes I started my career 9 years ago as a Graphic
      designer then a web designer, after that i was more of a user interface designer
      which is a role that you have to be involved more with developers assisting
      their work and always supporting them with slicing which made me very passionate
      about development in Silverkey Mohamed Meligy used to call me Friend of Developers
      :) and the rest of the team as well. \n\nIt was just very complicated for me
      to learn programming language such as C#. i tried a lot but i couldn't and i
      had all the mentality to resolve problems may be i wasn't a programmer but i
      could give him the solution in a direct way and he use his skills of programming
      to resolve it.\n\nAfter That When I moved to Mexico I had already a very good
      experience \"or that's what i thought :)\" as a User Interface Designer. and
      i had experience delivering .NET themes, Sharepoint Themes, etc... all what
      we use in most of the egyptian companies.\n\nThen I found a job as a Front End
      Developer in Freshout and it was actually funny because i was being hired to
      work on a project that was very late to be delivered and they contracted me
      for only 3 Months :) Now I'm almost 3 years working with them :)\n\nThey don't
      use any of the technologies we use in Egypt they were depending a lot on Ruby
      on Rails (I haven't heard of it before) and very high skills in Javascript which
      i didn't have as well. i was only depending on jQuery plugins. and lets say
      i had someone that really hated me for no reason and he was always giving a
      bad impression to my boss which was making me very angry and frustrated you
      want to learn to keep up but they are always pulling you down! So it wasn't
      a good start and i wasn't that easy.\n\nI found my self in a position where
      i must push my skills. BTW they don't use windows at all they use MAC which
      was also another challenge for me as I was a normal mac user never had the interest
      to push my skills in using a mac. and i was a loyal windows user :) that was
      another challenge for me also. You can say I'm a stubborn person which i insist
      about making something i dream of it days and night and I don't give up till
      I get it.\n\nNow I'm a Front End Developer I manage most of the projects in
      our company as an Agency and as a Product company I have a team working with
      me. My role can change a lot from a project to another sometimes I'm a Backend
      developer sometimes I'm a front End and sometimes My involvement in a project
      can be to project manage it. I get involved also in some decisions in the products
      we do. The person that was always giving bad impressions about me was working
      under my supervision in the future and he didn't like how the things got changed
      and he quite (I never treated him as he did). \n\nThe company has a HUGEEEE
      rule on my learning path and  they were helping me a lot to be the person I
      am now. and the person i will be in the future. they educated us on a different
      concept you can be the best programmer in the world but if you don't have a
      mentality to solve problems before you even start programming most probably
      you will make a disaster out of the project you are working on. you will not
      deliver on time and if you did you will have the worst un-maintainable code
      in this project."

      Thanks a lot Mohamed Alaa :)

      Can you expand more on the experience itself as well? How did you get from what you call a normal mac user to getting familiar with using Rails and Node tools daily? What was the learning path? The steps and phases if you see what mean. Thanks again.
