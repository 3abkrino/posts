  im building an ecommerce using wordpress/woocommerce,
  i got a theme and populated it with the demo content, but can't figure out how the products assigned to a certain page.
  normally i would add a product shortcode to the desired page, but  now i got those products assigned to the shop page and i don't know how they manage do it.(no shortcodes available)
