message: "I require help representing Prayer names (Asr, Magrib .. etc) in ipa or
  x-sampa phonetic alphabet. \n\nI'm working on a personal project, An Amazon Alexa
  skill to tell me the prayer times, and i only get data from the Local mosque for
  now. \n\nI have a problem with making Alexa pronounce the prayer names correctly.
  The only way to do it in a decent way is by using SSML (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_Synthesis_Markup_Language),
  (https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference)
  using the ipa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) or
  x-sampa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) alphabet. \n\nMy problems is that
  i have no idea how to pronounce the names correctly using any of those alphabets,
  and i haven't found any resource for that online. \n\nI'd appreciate any help, specially
  if any one has experience with phonetic alphabets."

      Wikipedia articles usually show how to pronounce a word. Check this as an example:
