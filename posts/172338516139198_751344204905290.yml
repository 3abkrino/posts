message: Guys, I would really like to be able to look at the source code of some intermediate
  (in size and how difficult the code is to understand) projects. Where do you think
  I could find such open source stuff to look at? It's for study purposes basically,
  because I feel there's a gap in my knowledge that can only be filled with real world
  source code to look at but all I found in that regard is very complex applications.
  So any help would be appreciated.

    message: Web stuff, I know php and Python as server side languages and all the
      other front-end stuff. And I know c# for desktop applications but I don't reckon
      there are many open source .net stuff, is there?

      Just off the top of my head, I'll dig out some more of my favourites later. It's also a good habit to check Github explore.

      Good luck
