message: "Hi All , \nCould anyone recommend for me any tutorial or github repository
  related to CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation )  and Event Sourcing
  ?  I searched a lot and nothing helps to take steps through it , most of results
  talk about the idea  or the theory more than the practical tutorial. Even the courses
  on pluralsight , I got bored from it .\nI'd appreciate too much if someone devote
  himself as a mentor for me especially in this topics , and I won't bother him  so
  much, I promise. \U0001F605\U0001F60A\nThanks in advance"

      You won't find a lot of stuff using most recent frameworks, but the differences are minimal anyway. Check on Google for videos by this guy "Greg Young" regardless of how old the video is.

      That'll be best if you are working with .NET.

      If so, googling `ddd net event sourcing cqrs` led me to some good results:
