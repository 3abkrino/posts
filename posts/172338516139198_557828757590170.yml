message: I'm now convinced that Chrome Sucks! Specially garbage collection. when you
  remove an element from the DOM it doesn't clear the memory of this element at once/at
  all. try to make a simple page with 3 iFrames and see the memory usage. then destroy
  all the dom of the page and notice the same memory usage if not increasing for this
  tab!
