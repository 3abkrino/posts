      list been tried out? Sent any emails yet? \nIf not, then I'm afraid whether
      an email address is reachable or not will be hard to discover early on but let
      me look it up. In general, you need to wait till an email bounces off an address
      multiple times to flag it.\n\nKareem Kashwaa a domain check won't need telnetting
      anywhere, just a run through a whois will be sufficient, looking up some dns
      values (mx records) and some predefined mail configurations for popular mail
      servers\n\n- Google apps\n- Microsoft live\n\nThen a tld extention check, that
      can be done through a registar, fairly easy as well, most offer apis\nAnd finally
      a regex rundown on the address\n\nThat ought to be sufficient for validation"

      Thanks Hady and Kareem. I'm aware that there are various products for this kind of thing, only that it's quite expensive, you can check a list here: http://www.marketingtechblog.com/verify-email-lists/

      That bit is that they are all quite expensive for my taste. Wouldn't pay couple of hundred bucks for something than can at least be done manually, you know.

      Kareem Kashwaa Telnet is an overkill and implies an intention to establish a session. You can ping the domain name to check if it's reachable to begin with or not.

      Abdelrahman Magdy  Don't sweat it, homegrown solution can be knocked up. What system are you running on top? Windows, Linux, Mac?

      Well, since we delved into it, Kareem Kashwaa In theory, you could also verify the existence of an email address at the host if it has any SMTP servers running. IIRC, SMTP had a verify command that'll do an address lookup and check if it has it or reachable to it.

      Except most MTAs will have it turned off to prevent spam. You'd likely get blacklisted too. So truly the most cost efficient way is to wait until an email bounces multiple times before flagging it as dead.

      Plus the additional validation techniques I mentioned above, from TLDs to regexs and pings.

      you can never check for other factors that may prevent emails form arriving,

      That's why I mentioned to email it multiple times and watch it bounce before crossing it off.

      Email address verification and validation is most possibly one of those 50 decade issues that are very less likely to be resolved into a single solution facade.

      It's significance is far too important to allow a clear cut automated solution. It's already a serious hassle that it's well formatted (spammable). It's like getting an API to verify if your home address exists, if you are present at home now and your national ID represents a real person.

      - Emails link directly to online identities and variations of personas that represent you (Twitter, Facebook, Work, University, Service X and Service Z)
      - Emails are your direct identity (no different than a real life ID)
      - The validity of an email is a likelihood indication that you are a real person who exists, on a personal level if we meet face to face I'll hand over an email or on in a more formal setting like here, I'm certainly "me" commenting for the most part. And on a business transaction level, you still verify "me" by emailing me a couple of emails (confirmation, welcome, follow up)

      You can't just, automate it all. You shouldn't. Spammers will have a field day.
