    message: Only 3 Hrs and I see significant changes on performance, But i didnt
      like the new UX. and takes time to find a certain button or something.. plus
      replication of chrome UI, for example FF used to put all its buttons and menus
      to the left of the screen (much as Opera btw), now they move the entire functionality
      into the right...
