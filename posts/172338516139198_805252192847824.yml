message: If I have a site built with HTML , CSS and JS. What are my options for storing
  and reading data ? I want to host it on Github Pages so I don't wanna use server
  side code to avoid the need for a server. Is using JSON the best way ? Are there
  alternative options ?

    message: just some categories such that each category has about 10 links and users
      can add links and all the categories are shown to all users and users can search
      for categories too. So reading and storing data are needed.

    message: Ahmed Kamal Writing to the server using the client side only is not possible,
      there has to be some server side script to handle this, which is not available
      in case of gh pages

    message: Ahmed Kamal There are some workarounds though, as I mentioned before,
      we had this problem while creating the group archive, one solution was to use
      parse.com api to upload data to their flat database and retrieve it as json,
      both could be done easily from javascript
