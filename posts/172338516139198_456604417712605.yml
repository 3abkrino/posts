    message: articles/posts tagging & better search, most of the time the answer is
      available but people -myself included- think about the problem & search using
      wrong keywords or at least not-totally-right keywords

    message: If you want to make offline community make your sessions as workshops
      to get hand-on real problem not just blah blah blah marketing crap or just simple
      introduction to one technology I mean take a workshop to learn something that
      you'll face it in your daily basis work. Most of the sessions I attend in Egypt
      communities are talking about simple introduction to one technology and not
      take it in depth and fave a real life problem. And please please make sessions
      take about Software Engineering Quality like TDD sessions and clean code sessions
      or may be agile sessions
