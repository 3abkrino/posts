message: "Hello Guys,\nJust wondering if you can help me choosing the best way to
  do the following:\nmy application is expecting to receive a huge data (Millions
  of records) , these data must be validated against some certain predefined rules.
  i am a bit not sure about the best way of implementing this without impacting the
  performance.\nObviously, there're always three ways to do it:\n1- Do my business
  in a stored procedure\n2- Retrieve the data from the DB then validate it using Linq.
  \n3 - Or, The option that I'd personally like to go for, which is creating a DB
  View for these data first, then validate it from a stored procedure or Linq. \n\nWhy
  do I prefer the last option?  well, because the data is actually stored in a normalized
  DB, and to be able to retrieve these data , i will go through plenty of joins.\n\nWhat
  do you think ba2a?"

    message: "What does your application architecture look like? Is this a full blown
      monolith? Cause if not, I don't see why a micro service can't be scaled over
      an orchestrator like Mesos using containers. You can use Marathon/Cattle as
      your init.d and spin up as many instances as your infrastructure can handle,
      marathon supports autoscaling based on predefined metrics per container health.
      \n\nIf what I'm saying sounds like gibberish to you, that's alright you can
      read more about orchestration and distributed systems by checking a product
      like the DC/OS or Rancher. \n\nhttps://rancher.com\nhttps://dcos.io"
