  Do I have to study computer science/have a computer science degree to make it as a developer? Or can I be a self-educated one through online resources?
  What's your experience with/opinion on that?

      I'm also trying to read a lot more about algorithms and data structures and
      the like, cause I feel it's hard to really take that next step without that
      sort of theoretical CS understanding. But I doubt they go any deep in Egyptian
      universities anyway so it's true that especially here, it's your best bet to
      learn everything online. Great list by the way.

      Short answer, no you don't. But you will have to work your ass off doing a lot of learning and doing!

      I am a computer engineering drop out, didn't complete college, and I have been working in this career for 10 years now.

      I got married, and I have an almost 4 years old kid :)

      Certificates are nothing if you got passion! And passion dictates that you do  A LOT OF HARD WORK!

      It is doable, but it is not easy or a fairy tale, it is one hell of a ride!
