message: "To those with unit testing experience,\nI need to test a class that that
  sends data to a repo, lets say the given class has 2 methods, one is Create, the
  other is Exists, Create adds a new entity to that repo and Exists checks if a certain
  entity exists on the repo, \nmy question is, if I want to test Exists and Create,
  can I use each method to test the other, but in this case I would have used an untested
  method to test another, If I'm to rewrite the logic used to add the entity, I would
  have broken the DRY principle, it seems like a loop, how should this be done?\nnote:
  mocking the repo is out of question"
