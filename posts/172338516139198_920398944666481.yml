  I ran across this nice little tool #miniLock which is an extension to Chrome, where you can encrypt files and share it with anyone knowing that only the person on receiving end can decrypt it.
  The tool is opens source, and peer reviewed, and relies heavily on the Elliptic Curve25519, which is considered a state of the art.
