    message: In your contract with this agency make each part separate and make price
      for it , the support should be a separate contract

      Three year support is long period, not even companies do it. So make sure you are capable of allocating time for three year support because depending on the size of the project they may call you on small things!

      Regarding the price as others mentioned this doesn't even cover the cost of developing the mobile apps. my advice is to break down your apps to small tasks, estimate them, sum the total working hours + buffer time then multiply it by your hour rate.
