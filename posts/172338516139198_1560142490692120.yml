  Any one here using Vagrant on windows 7 ?

  I installed Vagrant and VM VirtualBox, then added a box with "vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64", and now the Ubuntu box is visible when I use "vagrant box list", then I used "vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64" within the php7dev directory, but still nothing happens at all when I use "vagrant up" or "vagrant ssh" and there isn't even an error message displayed. Has anyone run into the same problem ?

    message: Not a first hand experience but I have some colleagues doing this successfully
      without issues on Windows 8.1. The only catch for Windows 8.1 and 7 is that
      the network tack has issues and you need to install an older version. That is
      already suggested by the Docker Toolbox (which installs VirtualBox for you if
      not installed already), so, I don't know, maybe uninstall everything and install
      VirtualBox via Docker Toolbox. I'll see if I can find specific information on
      the network driver issue.
