message: "i almost never see a job in information technology in Egypt with salary
  range  , i understand the whole  \"you get paid based on what you can do\" concept
  but you as a company/start-up/project owner must have a range in mind when advertising
  for a job  , posting the range will just get you the right category of people you
  can afford .\n \ni also notice there are absolutely no standards to local freelancing
  prices  , i challenge someone to offer the same project to 5 different developers/designers
  and getting the same prices or even close  , this is not limited to freelancing
  but to registered software companies (well  , maybe the big names monitor themselves
  and other companies with the same sizes and try to keep the game close so you will
  see they offer almost the same salary packages and also the same products/services
  prices  ) .\n\ni see this in general is not good for the industry & open the door
  to lot of \"Fahlawa\" , i honestly have no idea how to price my coding service to
  anyone requesting it  , and asking for ranges from friends is almost pointless as
  each one see himself according to his previous payments and sometimes to this \"ego\"
