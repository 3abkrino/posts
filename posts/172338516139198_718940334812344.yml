  Hi Geeks,
  Can anyone recommend a good mobile internet carrier? I know mobinil, vodafone and etisalat are all crap and overpriced, but out of the 3 which one will be more usable in terms of speed and coverage? Also, do all 3 carriers block VoIP services such as skype?

      I don't know much about coverage and speed. However, with regards to blocking VoIP services, it's not the carriers people should point the blame at. It's the NTRA.

      Edit: And yes, they all do block it. If one of them doesn't then they've either bribed someone or knowingly doing so against our telecommunication laws, policies and regulations.

    message: So far i believe that Vodafone is the best option. Packages are almost
      the same across the 3 companies. But when it comes to coverage and speed Vodafone
      is really good (at least for me). Also, regarding Skype it works  fine for me
      on Vodafone.

      Thanks Hady and Ahmed. Yes i remember a few years back when Skype was mysteriously blocked on 3G. I also know that they all down-sample images horribly in order to reduce bandwidth. So it's just a matter of picking the one that sucks the least..
      Do they all offer the same connection frequencies? For example have any of them got UMTS or LTE (or close to implementing it?)

      I think they all have HSPA+ (no LTE in Egypt yet), and about downsampled images, somehow they show a tooltip on images that says to press a certain keyboard shortcut to get the high-quality image (I don't know how they do this), but of course that only happens when you're sharing your connection with your laptop.
      and about Skype, a few years ago the suddenly start blocking it, but some time last summer Vodafone (not sure about the others) started allowing it again, it might have happened earlier without me noticing.

    message: Can't comment on the down sampling though, I have been using it for less
      than a day and on a tablet. Speed is alright on HSPA+, coverage is okay so far.
