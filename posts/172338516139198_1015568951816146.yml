  Hello geeks,

  My question is somehow complicated and rare :D

  I have a windows server that hosts some files for a third party. For some reason, the third party can not connect to get files except through sFTP.

  I have installed Cygwin ssh server on windows and enabled sFTP and everything works fine. He can connect and get the files.

  However, for the automated process of getting files, the third party needs key-based authentication instead of a regular username and password.

  I have followed every single tutorial about enabling this ( 99% of the tutorials are for Linux based servers ) but had no luck.

  Anyone faced this situation before or can suggest a solution ?

    message: I had problem getting IIS-served FTP to work with Filezilla FTP client
      earlier and it seemed like a roadblock (I don't remember the details now), so
      I did what someone else did as well and installed Filezilla FTP "Server", and
      that worked well for me. See if it supports what you need.

    message: I don't think doing the tunneling on your own will work. Your options
      might be either hosting a small TurnKey ready-made FTP-server VM, or another
      Windows FTP server program that supports SSH. Some gooogling suggests http://www.coreftp.com/server/
      and http://www.freesshd.com/ - they both don't look very promising but can give
      a try.

    message: Thanks Guys, I have resolved the issue. For those who want to know, Windows
      does not allow user context switching without providing explicit passwords.
      So, you will have to assign an administrator account to the cygwin server so
      it can use it for the impersonation process. I added the user and now, I can
      login using public key authentication normally as in Linux servers.
