    message: Are you trying to send it via a GET request?the maximum URL length in
      this case would be 255 bytes for most servers, you should be using a PUT request
      if you are uploading an image.

      Change max array length in endPoint in web config
      and HTTP will send large image just convert your image to array of bytes: byte[]
      and it will work
