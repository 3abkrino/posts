  Scott Hanselman just blogged about this .NET Library:
  http://humanizr.net/
  It's a library for manipulating and displaying strings, enums, dates, times, timespans, numbers and quantities.
  The amount of awesome functionalities is just too much :)
  and as an added bonus, it has Arabic Localization! (the developer seems to be from Arab descent)
