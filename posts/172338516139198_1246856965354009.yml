    message: "your question caught my attention while i am not in the video market
      but i started doing some research and read about it ,as far as i see fermi support
      in the NVENC \"SDK\" is not availble , and no one from the open source community
      is going for implementing cuda encoding for HA for that matter because of the
      hardware limitation is not cross compatible so the work is doubled or tripled
      for that matter to support each system , as i understood from your replay that
      you have fermi gpu farm while its not using HA but if its working dont fix it
      , but since you posted this question which mean you are not comfortable with
      your current situation you have 3 option \n1- upgrade your cards \n2- move to
      cloud and use CPU assistance which from what i read is far better than GPU \n3-
      ask some one to program a patch for you \"not recommended\" because the encoder
      is not supporting fermi anyway and it will all turn back to using CPU assistance
      or some other hack .\n*btw thanks for making me read about this subject"
