  Hello There!, I'm wondering. is there away to fire the window event before the div event?

      I think this is against the natural order of how events are propagated. So, here is a quick hack: the div event handler stops event propagation, so the event handling will stop here, then we can manually do what we want.

      I modified the fiddle to show what I mean.

      There are two phases of event dispatching.
      1. Event capturing, this happens from parent to child, and happens first
      2. Event bubbling, which happens from child to parent, and happens after capturing

      All recommendation is to use event bubbling as much as possible. I think jQuery doesn't event support event capturing
      So, to do this, you can use the DOM API directly, like http://jsfiddle.net/au1hpj5L/2/

    message: I think the point of trying to run the window handler first is to not
      have to modify inner DOM handlers, but that's something the OP needs to decide
      on.
