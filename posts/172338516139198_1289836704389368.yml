    message: I don't think that's what I meant, what I meant is I need a way to package
      the imports with my project so when I run it anywhere I don't need to import
      the packages again. Like compiling an exe.

    message: for example, my program uses numpy and sklearn, I want to run it on other
      computers that don't have those installed. Can I do that?
