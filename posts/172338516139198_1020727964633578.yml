message: Does it make any engineering sense to use ReactJS in conjunction with AngularJS?
  or is it just geeky? I am ok with geeky, I just want to know if anyone tried it
  before in some real project and if there were any lessons learned?

    message: My understanding as I have always seen it presented is that it is an
      either-or. What parts of Angular you are contemplating to replace with React?

    message: I understand. So you are thinking of implementing the directive function
      using React DOM manipulation? If so, this sounds somewhat reasonable and not
      too geeky. However, unless speed is the primary concern, the template-based
      approach is much a lot more readable.

    message: "Mohamed Elsherif it depends on the problem you are trying to solve here.
      if you are trying to solve the slow rendering issue with Angular then I would
      for sure recommend you to go for React with Angular for accelerating the time
      it takes Angular to render it's own directives. I'm working on some tests to
      see if it's really worth mixing  both libraries or just going for React. \n\nAlso
      note the price of including both frameworks in terms of adding complexity and
      debugging who to blame if something goes wrong is it React? or is it Angular?
      (Just an Advice: Study both of them and stick to one of them)."

      sense so i kept my self to Angular without being distracted , i did not find
      something so unique with React
