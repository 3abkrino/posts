message: "Hi guys, how re u doing? \n\nI know this is out of the group topic and discussion
  scope, but I really need advice and I will delete this post later on shortly.\n\nI
  was trying to unlock my HTC bootloader so I can get my phone rooted, I didn't backup
  my data and suddenly after the unlock process end the phone rebooted and factory
  rest was performed along with the unlock process. My greatest mistake to not backup
  my data locally or to the cloud.\n\nIs there any reliable way to restore my android
  phone data?\n\n*I don't have any backups except my contacts on G account.\n\nThanks
  in advance for your interaction with my post."

    message: Don't know how you can get back stuff that was on the phone itself, but
      for the SD Card you can put it in a laptop and run one of the undelete tools
      on it (like Recuva).
