  Think twice before you reply to this:
  Why would you use "DevExpress" or similar reporting plugins while you may spent more hours developing your own reports using HTML and CSS and win the performance battle?

      \nThis is the engineering mind playing a classic trick on you, that I could
      have built this better over the weekend, or whatever similar self promoting
      promises that you will never be able to achieve, not because you lack skill
      but because that's not what you were set up to do in the first place, it doesn't
      make any financial sense to build everything yourself, you focus on your core
      problem and spend all the time and effort on it, and use any financial resources
      available to solve any other related needs or problems."

    message: Do you want to allow end users to create their own reports? It's easier
      for programmers to create the report in code, but harder to create a report
