  Question

  I am implementing a rest service with spring framework

  I want to return a string as a JSON
  like that:
  "something"

  the problem is.. when I return the string and produces = "application/json; charset=utf-8" the result returned without the quotes:
  something

  and when I wrap the string in a class to be converted to json by the framework automatically.. the result returned with the property name which i don't want:
  {"value":"something"}

  I simply want the returned result like this:
  "something"
  and to be a JSON of course

  could anyone help

    message: It's doing the right thing, this is JSON. The response you want to return
      from the server is NOT JSON format. If you want this simple string, make it
      just return text. "text/plain"

      Can't you just escape the quotation marks you want in the string?
      Like instead of:
      "something"
      Go with:
      "\"something\""
