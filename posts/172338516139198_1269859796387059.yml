message: "Salam guys,\n\nI'm trying to host my relational database on a shared location
  to allow other people for collaboration. In addition, I'll use this hosting to connect
  to my website in the near future. \n\nI'm looking for the cheapest hosting service,
  my database size is not more than 5 GB.\n\nI looked up some services like AWS, Azure.
  Both of them are very expensive, is there another way that can help? I don't want
  to pay more than 10$ per month.\n\nI appreciate your replies. :)"

      Both Linide or Digitalocean have low cost plans under 10$, Just as mentioned above don't connect to the database directly.

      Create an API to work with the database and then use it, that's better from performance and, security perspective - as MySQL by default don't use secure connection (don't know about other databases but i assume you want a free database).

      If you are OK using JavaScript, you can give LoopBack a shot.
