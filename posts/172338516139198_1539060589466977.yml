      first thing before using any extra resources, try to optimize ur algorithms or queries this is the cheapest and most effective solution

      then consider exploiting parallelism

      then think about adding resources msh el 3aks

    message: "1- Your problems could be summarized in that your application is waiting
      for responses from remote sites, and in this case you need to make use of async
      programming, I am not sure to what extent it is supported in java, but it exists
      in .net.\n2- Also, if you already know the pages, try to cache the results somewhere.\n3-
      multithreading/parallel programming will help if parsing the pages take too
      much time, which I don't is your case. \n4- going cloud will cost you $$$$"
