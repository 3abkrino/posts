  Hey guys, I have a problem, I upgraded from ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04, and my splash screen got into an infinite loop of splashing between it and VCE error message. After some searching around, I found out that it is a problem of fglrx and radeon drivers as ubuntu decided to ditch them, so I blacklisted them through recovery, but I am still getting the same error and now my laptop is inaccessible (as when the screen keeps splashing, I cant even boot into terminal using ctrl+alt+f1)
  Error message: radeon :VCE init error (-110)
