  How much should I ask as a freelance for a .net website with 75% static content, 25% dynamic, and about 6 to 9 pages?
  It's here in Egypt! and It's the first time working on a freelance website like that so I don't know how to quote it.

      Estimate the estimated man hours needed for each page/feature. And send him a report about it. Make sure to add extra hours as problems always occur.

      Then tell him my man hour is x$

      Calcualte it by hours + extra profit margin.. for example if developer average salary is 1000 per month then one hour = 1000 over number of average monthly working hours
      Don't forget to add extra charge if u r working on something unique or not common
