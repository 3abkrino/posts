    message: Are you using a script manager? if you are not you might be having some
      trouble writing the right path for jQuery script in your page, especially if
      your master page is not on the same level as your other pages.

    message: This is exactly what's happening, I'm not using a script manager . the

    message: If you are using a Script Manager it is easy, because you can reference
      the script from the root folder using ~/ so wherever the page that ends up using
      the Masterpage it will have the right path

    message: One more thing you can do, if you don't wanna use Script manager, is
      to use one of the public online jQuery CDN's I believe Google was providing
      one let me fetch that for you

      You can use something like the following without Script Manager:
      <script src='<%= ResolveUrl("~/Scripts/jquery-1.6.2.min.js") %>' type="text/javascript"></script>
      And make sure that the file you referenced in the jQuery one, and I would recommend to redownload it again in case of download issues (md5check)
