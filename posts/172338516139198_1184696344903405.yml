  Dear Valued Customer, please note that Emirates NBD cards will be disabled for international use outside Egypt only effective 24th of July 2016 till further notice. Apologies for any inconvenience.

  Recieved this message from my bank is concerning my credit card (not debit) and i called them and they confirmed this message and they even confirm no online payment will be authorized . Anyone know if this sole bank decision or central bank decision.
