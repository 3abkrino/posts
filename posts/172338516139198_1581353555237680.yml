message: "for a student who is just gonna start his 3rd year in faculty of cs , which
  is better in \"your\" \"opinion\" ?\npick a specific technology in the market let's
  say android and start working on it  and have an internship then a job/part time
  (while studying) or stick with trying new things like machine learning or image
  procession ...etc  , doing side projects and entering contests like Microsoft's
  Imagine Cup , ACM .. etc. \nPS : the internship is kinda guaranteed during this
  time , however it won't be available later ( ofc i can apply next summer or something
  but i won't be able to work during this year )\nthank you for your time."

    message: 'I think you need to "Merge" the two approaches as you can spend all
      your life trying new technologies but you''ll never finish as nearly every day
      there is something new to learn , you can start by trying the trendiest technologies
      in a descending way for example: web dev , mobile dev  ( you can dig really
      deep you''ll find so much things to learn !! )..... etc.'

    message: Stress on concepts not technologies, after that master a programming
      language of your choice side by side to SQL basic queries. Then start to choose
      one framework for the selected language.
