  [Q] Replaced my HP Probook 4540s original battery with 4330s lousy - made in china- one ...
  The problem, it doesn't accept charging (plugged in and charging) but no charge percentage increase !

  Some numbers u may ask for :
  Old battery voltage = this one
  Old mAh is 4300 < this one 4400

  Contacted the IT seller but is it a myth or a real to let it 8 hours charging -while lap is off- for the first time to work properly ?

  I tried googling if u can teach me better keywords :
  q=replace+hp+probook+4540s+battery+with+%24
  q=%22replace+probook+4540s+battery+with+4330s+battery%22
  q=replaced+battery+won%27t+charge
  q=replaced+hp+battery+won%27t+charge
