      Nourhan you mentioned you tried " the socialsharing plugin" ... I am quite sure  nobody here knows what that is, it seems like a very generic thing.
      In order to get people to help you, you should show steps of what you did and what errors did you encountered.
      Let me quote something from Stackoverflow:
      "Focus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do."
      One last thing, please read "How do I ask a good question?"
