  Hello Geeks,
  Have anyone encountered this problem when signing-up for AWS ?

  The address entered appears to be invalid, please check the Country, City and Postal Code and retry.

  Searching indicates that AWS has problem with special characters which I don't have in any of my signing-up details.
