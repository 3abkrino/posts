message: Is there anyone out here tried to publish a mobile app with 2 versions (ad-supported
  & premium ad-free) in the local market (egypt)? and if yes ; is it worthwhile ,
  are people here really are willing to pay money for such value of just removing
  ads ?

    message: It's pretty rare to someone in Egypt actually paying for software offline..
      let alone online! it's a culture that we all contributed in developing when
      we handed out people cracked software and pirated movies.. we are all guilty
      :-)

    message: Why you use 2 different version .. Make one version with ads and Apple
      allows to remove ads by paying money this is an important  feature with inapp-purchase
