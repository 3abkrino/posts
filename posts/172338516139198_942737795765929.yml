message: "[PHP coders only]\nI never liked the idea of using a framework. Like many
  of us, I always had an opinion about everything in these frameworks, and I wanted
  things to be done MY way. \nAfter 7+ years writing PHP using my own frameworks (started
  with something called Unique, then Zonda and finally Rhino), I started looking at
  frameworks like Phalcon and Laravel, and I said to myself: it's time to use someone
  else 's code!\nSo, what is your framework of choice?"
