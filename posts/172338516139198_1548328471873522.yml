    message: I haven't used either of them but I can tell you than no language is
      necessarily than the other. It usually comes down to how good you are with a
      given language

    message: I can't answer your question but can suggest a few things for your to
      consider. You will need little exposure to many technologies as you progress
      in IT industry. The one thing I know for sure is that "technologies" change
      everyday. So it's really beneficial to start by simple "Hello World" application
      and a simple few hours application to get a broad idea of what each of them
      can provide you with. See the features and products built with each of them.
      Then you can decide yourself which technology you want to "start" with for a
      deep dive. I'd strongly suggest that you make sure you're excellent in CS fundamentals
      (data structures, algorithms and problems solving) and excellent in how to evaluate
      technologies for the problem at hand.

      ... ميزة رهيبة في ال php وهي توفر الCMS المبنية عليه الكثير اوي زي الووردبريس
