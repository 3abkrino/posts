    message: I did. The new colour is such a major turn off for me though that I rarely
      use it. Even the dark theme is broken in some area.

    message: I won't get into "steeling" discussions because they usually don't interest
      me, but anyway, the new UI is actually Zune and "Metro" inspired, that is the
      Windows 8 UI not Expression UI. You'd feel this especially from the unified-colour
      icons for example
