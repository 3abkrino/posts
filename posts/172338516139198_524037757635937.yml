      ,TeamLab is written in ASP.NET while Redmine is written in Ruby but both work
      great for me

    message: If this is on projects scale, then maybe Redmine, which is more of a
      complete tracker, if that's what you want. Other than that, then maybe any note
      taking application should do the job.

    message: Mohamed Meligy sorry for late. I'm not sure what's exactly the case but
      i think Atlassian Jira (+ Greenhopper if you work Scrum) are good especially
      that you'll have free trial & cost is trivial if you decided to buy (I remember
      $10 for Jira & $20 Jira + Greenhopper)

      Ah sorry, It seem I didn't get the question right.. sorry it's Saturday :)
      For time tracking there's a great tool call RescueTime but It's not following Pomodoro Technique (If I got u right).. There's another very simple tool call Focus Booster based on Pomodoro Technique

    message: Mohamed Alaa, try the tool RescueTime, FocusBooster, etc., maybe define
      activities per projects and so, it should help you a lot track your time for
      things you charge per hour. Thanks Waheed Sayed :)
