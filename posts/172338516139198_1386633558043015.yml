message: "Does anyone have experience with handling back button function using Javascript
  or jQuery? \n\nI have a web application which will work mainly as a part of mobile
  application using web view\n\nAll the application is written in only one html and
  divided into different divs, and I use the script to manipulate html by showing
  and hiding what I want. \n\nI am doing this because I use local storage to store
  cookies of the user and use it in my app. \n\nI have been searching for something
  that may help to override the default function of back button, but I didn't find
  yet. \n\nThanks"

      I think most frameworks like Angular provide some solution for state management which should take care of the history including back button, but if you want something outside of these frameworks, you can try Sammy.js which pretty simple

    message: Also you can't override the back function, you can only make the history
      reflect the change in state, then the back button will make sense

      I solved it with help of a friend by 2 simple steps:

      1- I used location.hash to add different hash to the address with each different div
      2- Then added on window hashchange function including if case inside it that show the content according to the current location hash in the address bar.

      Thanks a lot all for your help!
