  I have a question for guys who know about SEO (search engine optimization). What is the best way to know which search engine is the source of the visit?
  For example, I have a website and I want to recognize the clicks that come from a specific website (i.e. google) to know the effectiveness of ads for a given platform vs the other
  What is the best place to do that?
  I looked it up, some people say it could be done by placing some metadata on the SEO listing itself but I never have done that before and not sure if it could be done this way or not?

      That's not an SEO question actually. That's a tracking / analytics question.

      Most of the analytics services should be able to answer that. You'll need to install them on your website to collect data first. Often "installation" only means including a bit of JavaScript.

      Something like Google Analytics can do the job very well, proven and free.
