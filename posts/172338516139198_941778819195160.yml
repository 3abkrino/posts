    message: Can it completely replace jQuery in your opinion? Or are they meant for
      different situations/tasks?

      Both were created to handle different tasks. I don't think it's smart to compare both libraries. Angular was created to take HTML to the next step, it's amazing with data binding and much much more.

      AngularJS even has something called jQueryLite that offers most of the jQuery functionalities (like .addClass/On/change/ ... ) !

      You can compare AngularJS to libraries like React or Ember.
