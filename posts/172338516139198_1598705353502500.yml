message: "I want to rapid prototype an angularjs app. \n\nIts an interview task; but
  its been a while since i started a new angulajs(1.5) app. \n\nWhich starter should
  i use ?\n\nI usually use webpack+babel+es6+jasmin following tdd: but i feel like
  its an overkill for angular1 test project. Specially that most of my other angulajs
  apps i started in 2014-2015 before moving to react world i used bower and gulp and
  no es6. \n\nSo what build system did you use as  for angulajs(1) apps recently?"
