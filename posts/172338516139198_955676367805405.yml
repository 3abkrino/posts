  Fellow geeks,
  Some of you post wonderful links to interesting content, which I for one am almost always thankful for. It would be great if you included a couple of sentences about the content that you were linking to though. Many of us browse on phones, and so it is actually rather inconvenient to have to open up a browser only to discover that the content is not relevant to you - it's not just sheer laziness. Hope you consider that in your future posts.

  Thanks.
