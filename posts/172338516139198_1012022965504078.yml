      1. OpenGL ES on Android is similar to OpenGL on the desktop, it's a subset and it uses fixed-point math instead of floating point (used on the desktop), so you'll have to be familiar with that as well.
      2. Yes, OpenGL is a platform independent graphics library and works on several platforms including consoles.
