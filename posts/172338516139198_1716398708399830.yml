    message: I am interested in knowing these algorithms .. specially the triangulation
      ones.

      You want to generate a mesh from point cloud data ... in realtime ... on a phone?!! :O
      I don't think this is possible besara7a, even on a PC it would be better to generate the mesh (and simplify it!) ahead-of-time.

    message: 'An alternative that might also solve your problem: I''m not sure exactly
      how it''s done, but I think it''s possible to pass the points to the GPU (as
      points not as triangles), and have a shader render a small sprite at that point,
      or maybe use a geometry shader to generate a small shape in place of each point.
      El fekra en if the points are so close to each other, the sprites/shapes could
      intersect covering up the gaps.'

      Have you considered maybe converting the point cloud data into volumetric data and using a realtime volume rendering technique? (I did a significant amount of reading on realtime volume rendering, so I could help with that)
      It could be more performant, but less quality, depending on the data.
