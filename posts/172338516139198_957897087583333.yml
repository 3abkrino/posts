message: "This is the most weirdest vulnerability I've ever seen, The XSS payload
  got stored somehow in a cookie on ebay's remote server and I have exploited it without
  being logged in or even putting a payload on either GET or POST request and via
  a private browsing by just manipulating the referrer and the search string parameters
  which are stored in the cookie. It's pretty obvious that they're storing the referrers
  and the search history strings in their database unsanitized.\n\n"
