      LOL! knowing how to code is a skill, knowing how to programe in a specific lang is just some rules to learn... So they are diff.
      Anyways, I will send a book.

      Trust me. Even if she doesn't know C#, common sense alone will get her through
      it just fine.

      this course was enough for me to get basic things done with ASP.NET MVC 5 : http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aspdotnet-mvc5-fundamentals
      but i really recommend watching the same course about version 4 first : http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mvc4 , this will start talking about the MVC pattern from scratch, then start building a simple CMS by examples. BTW Scott Allen is my HERO regarding .NET stuff , you will find a lot of interesting things on his other courses and the articles on his blog. http://odetocode.com/
