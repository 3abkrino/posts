  Is there a problem with Phpstorm supporting Angular 2 ?
  I've searched a lot for support and tried many things and they all failed and it seems like Webstorm has all the support for Angular and other Front-end frameworks.

  Did anyone try it for phpstorm?

      I did build a couple of small apps using Angular2 on PHPStorm 2016.2.2
      Not the best support ever but it autocompletes, suggests missing imports, etc.
