  Hi guys,
  What is the best way to take a screen shot for a specific html tag id,
  I'm currently using jsPDF but i have problems in quality and some test cases failed so i have to find another way, But it has to be Client Side.
  Thanks in advance :).

      If you are looking for a JavaScript alternative that you can use for business
      I am not sure you have other options than jsPDF

    message: I used to use html5canvas 3rd party, but also I got no good or reliable
      results from this one. There's option I didn't try it. Use headless browser
      on the backend side to generate the same image on the client, I know you stated
      you need something on the client side, but you should get the same result.

    message: It's basically a dom element, into a canvas, then into an image. I remember
      doing this for a simple comic designing tool, and it worked fine for me.
