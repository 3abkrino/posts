  Full Stack Overflow developers work almost entirely by copying and pasting code from Stack Overflow instead of understanding what they are doing. Instead of researching a topic, they go there first to ask a question hoping people will just give them the result.

  Using something that works immediately, even if you don’t know how it does it, feels better than encountering the frustration of not being able to fix something.

  Posting the “one true solution” and winning a thread on Stack Overflow feels great – even if we have no plan whatsoever to come back to it later if it turns out not to be such a good idea any longer as the environment changed.

  So what? Why is it a problem if people are faster and more effective in releasing products?

  even stack overflow nooooooooooooooo ,the essay aim's to decrease feast  happiness ,just joking ....
