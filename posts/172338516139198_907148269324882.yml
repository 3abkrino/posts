  Hello all..I'd like to ask about somthing related to gps trackers.. if any one can help plz .
  Is it a must to have a SIM  card in the device ?
  If not I'd like to know how it works? ?
  As I googeld it I found some devices working with a  Sim card and some without. . That's confusing me.. I mean  gps tracker devices not mobile phones. . Thnx in advance..
