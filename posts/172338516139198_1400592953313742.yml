message: "Can you represent 4 bits with only two bits ?!\nI tried but I cannot\nThe
  same i cannot represent 10 digits with only 5 digits.\nIs this true for any number
  of digits? \nCan we represent big numbers with small numbers using some compression
  or hashing?"

    message: Without any constraints it doesn't make sense. If you can store any 4
      bit number using only 2 bits, then why would you use a 4 bit number in the first
      place.

      It is simply math, to represent any decimal number n you need this number of bits
      b = ⌊log2(n)⌋ + 1

      read about information theory and huffman coding
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
      also look at Michael Azmy's comment
