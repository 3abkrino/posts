message: Hello All , I was creating an account on openshift.com and found that I can't
  use Egypt as my country so I assume I can't pay with an Egyptian credit card, which
  PaaS provider do you suggest which support paying from Egyptian Credit Card ? "or
  PayPal from Egypt"

      By the tune you have 10 million active users you will have written your app 10 times already and Bern using a mix of languages and platforms, hence surely changed your hosting requirements.
      That will be a goods problem to have, and you just cannot plan for it now. That passing may disturb you from starting to get your first active 10 users if the 1st place :)
