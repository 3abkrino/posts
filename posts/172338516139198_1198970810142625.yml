  Hello everybody,

  anybody integrated Google reCAPTCHA2 within a modal box and made it work with:

  - WIndows7
  - IE (10 || 11) ?

  Notes:
  - Working fine with any other OS/browser.
  - Windows 10 + IE (10 || 11) => Works fine...
  - Non modal => working with all combinations..
  - I use $.magnificPopup() modal box, not bootstrap one.

  - Came across this but didn't help
