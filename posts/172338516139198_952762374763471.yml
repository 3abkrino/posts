  For Linux geeks:
  I saw people here (especially Islam Gad) talking about Elementary linux distro

  So I checked it out and it's amazing...

  I'm not really a linux expert but I'm trying to get used to Ubuntu and when I read about Elementary they said it's based on Ubuntu

  so can you please tell me what it's pros and cons ?

  Is it ready to be used on daily basis to do heavy work

  Is Freya stable enough or what exactly ? I just want to know what do you think about it overall

  Thanks a lot

  And in case some of you doesn't know about it here's a video:
