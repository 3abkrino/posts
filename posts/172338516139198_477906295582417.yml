    message: ":) if your company has a proxy (TMG or ISA) and you set the proxy configuration
      through the internet option you might found windows update not working and essential
      security also not updating so to solve this you run the mentioned command to
      redirect any request to the proxy you set before. Because not evey requests
      goes though the proxy server even if set it in the internet option"

      You can set the HTTP_PROXY environment variable to http://username:password@proxy_ip:port

      This will tell Windows to tunnel all HTTP traffic to the proxy

      When you set HTTP_PROXY, you don't need to set internet options from IE

      I believe that HTTP_PROXY works on Linux too
