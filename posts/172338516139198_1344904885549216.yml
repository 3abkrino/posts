  Me and many friends of mine always want to write opensource projects to support or fulfill specific needs and help other software developers ( and not just our daily needs ) and all of us have the same issue addressing the real needs of the market so we can build the right software and help more people

  I'm pretty sure some of you had the same issue and you end up writing only the libs and services you need

  how do you think we can solve that? how can OSS devs address the needs of the market and write the right solution? do you think there should be a place for that?

  P.S: One of the proposed options is contributing to ongoing projects but I don't think this is solving the whole issue.

    message: I think you can't cover such point, but one good thing about this is
      you open source you solution, someone else fork it and add more features and
      so on ... the main goal is enriching the open source community to shortcut the
      process not to just totally cover it.

      Many of the successful open source projects that I know of were created by their developers to solve a personal itch they had. They were solving their own problems, and were not trying to just solve problems based on other people requests.

      With exceptions of course.

      Start with solving something that causes *you* pain. Chances are you will be solving it for other people in the planet too, and you will also have good understanding of the problem as opposed to having a request to develop something, as well as a bigger motivation to solve it.
