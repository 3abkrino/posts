      Thanks Mohamed for the mention and sorry for my delayed reply.

      Hi Emad, I used to be involved in the InfoSec field  17 years ago jumping between Malware Analysis, Malware writing and Reverse Engineering then shifted totally to Web, Mobile and thick-client desktop application Penetration Testing. I'm more into offensive security, RedTeaming and enthusiastic about Physical Security. What i'm doing now i'm working as Information Security Analyst and in charge of Product Security in the largest eCommerce company in LATAM plus struggled to built my own CyberSecurity company "Seekurity" in Mexico which focusing on offering security consultation services and building Security Automation Products.

      Nice to meet you!
