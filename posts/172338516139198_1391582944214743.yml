  Hi there

  tl;dr : Know a software marketing firm/agency that can help me spot and reach customers and finish deals with them, for a commission?

  For sometime now I've been working a software application. Now that it's ready I found myself facing so much challenges trying to market it. I believe now that partnering with a software marketing firm/agency can help me find and reach my customers (do you agree?). So, do any of you have tried this and has a tip for me? Can you point one or two of these firms for me ?

  Thanks in advance.

  PS: If you are wondering about the software, it's called "Tamkeen", a learning management system. Visit tamkeenlms.com for more information.
