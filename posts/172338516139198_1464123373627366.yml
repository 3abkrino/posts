message: "hi , \nI'm in a great need for your advice ,\nI am in my final year & will
  be graduate after a couple of weeks insha'Allah (قولوا يا رب :'D) \nI am very very
  passionate about Cyber Security , In the past I was focusing in networks but this
  year my Graduation Project is related to Automotive Intrusion Detection/Prevention
  System, and Vulnerabilities and things like this ,\nactually i found this track
  is also very nice :'D \nwhich is better in getting involved in and find a Good position
  in Security and Automotive Security in specific ,\nto focus on getting a job as
  \"Embedded Software Engineer \"  in order to move to a team working on security
  related projects and so on - I think this will take much more time but will keep
  me hands on code and help me to go abroad -\nor go back to my Networks Shell :'D
  and try to Get Network Security position - this may be look faster road but i know
  i will lose my programming skills by time and i think the ability to travel abroad
  will be much less than the benefits of the 1st position - \n\nPlease correct me
  if i was mistaken in any of the written info and Guide me to the proper road , I
  love both tracks \n\nmy skill set is : \n* In Networks : CCNA (R&S) certified -
  CCNA(sec) - CCNP \n* In Automotive : Embedded C - CAN protocol - CAPL Scripting
  - CANoe -ARM -AUTOSAR basics -  RTOS\n\nI welcome all your advice and criticism,
  show me the road \U0001F64F\nEmbedded Vs. Networks"
