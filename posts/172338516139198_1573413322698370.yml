  Hey, guys.
  Not really a question more of a discussion.
  I'm wondering how do you stay focused on one topic?
  I'm a fresh front-end developer (can't even get a job yet) but at the same time I'm very excited to get into Android development, game development and graphic design.
  But I don't have nearly enough time.
  Do you think that if web development doesn't feel like "enough" for me then it's not my true passion and I should try something else? Or should I just stick with it and see what happens?

      knowledge more than mobile as a fresh graduate, if you are searching for your
      passion then try them all but dont waste a lot of time of course, but if you
      mastered the logic and general big picture of programming then switching from
      a platform to another will be too easy. \nTo add in you information front end
      tools and frameworks now can implement mobile, web, desktop applications and
      also creating games. \nMaster javascript and you will rule your passion. \nIts
      my personal thinking not accurate enough maybe. \nWishes you good luck getting
      a new job"

      matter for me now what language and if it the effective one in it's field that's
      because I'm a freshman coder I guess, I do have the same feeling you're going
      through, but jumping around isn't good at all , I guess the best choice is to
      be nearly a pro in one field before learning the next skill, and the most important
      part is to try to make money out of it \U0001F602\nWHICH I NEVER DID TILL NOW
      ,\nI'm just curious what do you know so far in web dev.??"
