  the news to see it growing each day, the problem here is there are millions of unsecured
  IoT  devices that Mirai will acquire and the DDOS will get harder and harder each
  time, is there anyone interested in the same topic, does you know how this gonna
  stop, or they how they gonna batch all of those unsecured devices, what will happen
  after a year when this Botnet doubled several time ?"
