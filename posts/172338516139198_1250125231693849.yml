  hello geeks,
  i have a question ...
  i made a framework of applications ... its something private that i have been working on.
  so in order to put it in action i needed 2 pc's running windows server.

  it consists of several nodes

  main_node <-> security node <-> auth_node <-> Node_Manager <-> gateway

  Node_Manager:
  ->client_node <-> launches the nodes 1~x the the same server for client_node.
  ->Node 1
  ->Node 2
  ->Node 3
  etc ....

  the problem is that my client_node could be launched several times.
  when i made it i designed it that way for security reason and load balancing

  so when ever i launch the client_node the Node_Manager asks for both (internal ip,wan ip)
  and starts to manage the session encryption between every node (its dynamic for every node depends on the time/ip subnets)

  so i can not launch the client_node more that one time on the same system because of the ip subnet and nodes mutex.

  i ran it on a vps.
  what i need is to make the windows act like if it has another Ethernet adapter with another ip to force the node to create
  different mutex.

  so here is what i have tried
  - a vm system hosting windows server and i tried all types of ethernet config available
  - external vpn which worked fine except the node asks for a local ip to connect back to.
  - a loopback adapter
  - a proxy hosted on another system except it asks for a local ip
  - creating a system hook service and push back every packet to the buffer as a temp fix but it didn't work because of my in-app virtualization
  - creating custom firewall routes using powershell

  i suffered from that problem for weeks,
  so any suggestions?

  thanks!

    message: If I understood this correct, did you try launching client node with
      same ip but different port? Also, I think you can find some open source tools
      and/or algorithms to manage such a distributed system...

      first of all, thank you for your replay.
      yes i tried different ports but the problem that the security node filters any other connection because of the ip address subnet check .... when i tried the vpn i configured portforword and also configured the main node to start on the vpn's subnet

    message: Continuing on Khaled M. Diab answer cannot you filter based on socket
      not ip then load balance the clients it seems just the matter of recognising
      the port

      how did you implement the security node? or more specifically the encryption algorithm?
      for example, tcp enables (de)multiplexing using (ip address,port) tuples.
