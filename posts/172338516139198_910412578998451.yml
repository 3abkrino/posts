message: 'I hope the following is appropriate for this group. I''m looking to get
  advice on an ideal Wordpress development environment/workflow. After some years
  of working inefficiently, and sometimes recklessly (often working directly on live
  sites, sometimes finding sites broken several steps in, and then resorting to backups,
  sometimes at a server level, and trying to remember the steps I took and want to
  renew), I''m trying to refine a better setup: Vagrant (under VirtualBox on OSX)
  for local WP development (initially using the VVV configuration, though I''m looking
  into other configurations) --> GIT for version control (using Tower for OSX: still
  learning my way around this one) --> Codekit to keep browsers automatically refreshed
  --> Beanstalk from Tower to push and pull branches to and from local to the production
  server (I''m looking into running all my sites from a single git repository, with
  domains segmented out in branches, so I can keep to the free, one repository Beanstalk
  plan) --> WP Sync DB Master plugin (a free fork of the premium plugin WP Migrate
  DB Pro that works perfectly for migrations and backups) to pull and push databases
  between local and remote without having to edit databases --> Command line cache
  purge for Cloudfare and MaxCDN where necessary (still working on this) ---> Automated
  backup to Dropbox from the production server using BackWPup plugin. I''m not there
  yet on all the above, but this is where I''m heading. I''d be very appreciative
  of any input, or alternative suggestions.'
