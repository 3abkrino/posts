message: 'I hope the following is appropriate for this group. I''m looking to get
  advice on an ideal Wordpress development environment/workflow. After some years
  of working inefficiently, and sometimes recklessly (often working directly on live
  sites, sometimes finding sites broken several steps in, and then resorting to backups,
  sometimes at a server level, and trying to remember the steps I took and want to
  renew), I''m trying to refine a better setup: Vagrant (under VirtualBox on OSX)
  for local WP development (initially using the VVV configuration, though I''m looking
  into other configurations) --> GIT for version control (using Tower for OSX: still
  learning my way around this one) --> Codekit to keep browsers automatically refreshed
  --> Beanstalk from Tower to push and pull branches to and from local to the production
  server (I''m looking into running all my sites from a single git repository, with
  domains segmented out in branches, so I can keep to the free, one repository Beanstalk
  plan) --> WP Sync DB Master plugin (a free fork of the premium plugin WP Migrate
  DB Pro that works perfectly for migrations and backups) to pull and push databases
  between local and remote without having to edit databases --> Command line cache
  purge for Cloudfare and MaxCDN where necessary (still working on this) ---> Automated
  backup to Dropbox from the production server using BackWPup plugin. I''m not there
  yet on all the above, but this is where I''m heading. I''d be very appreciative
  of any input, or alternative suggestions.'

      I dont think its a good idea to make more than one website in one git repo. Bitbucket is an alternative which provides unlimited private repos and if  you can develop the whole website publicly then github is even better.
      For big projects you can make your project-specific deploy scripts along with the use of post commit hooks to move your code from the repo to the hosting server (Research more on the topic of git workflows, bitbucket help is a great resource for this topic).
      git-ftp is a useful command line tool to push files through git if I dont have full ssh access to the server (maybe old websites on shared hosting).
      consider fitting grunt/gulp, and bower into your workflow to automate most of the repetitve tasks during development.
      Finally, your development workflow will be constantly evolving because tools come and go. So introduce new tools to your workflow as long as you see the value they provide to your project.

    message: Thanks for the feedback. The reason I was looking to stay within Beanstalk
      was both to skirt around FTP (i.e., cut out a stage), but also for the GUI.
      I'm one of those (yes, I know) that tries to avoid the command line when I can.
      But perhaps I can find a way to integrate that function with Alfred, which is
      great for keyword or trigger scripting. I agree that it's better to have domains
      in their own repositories. Thanks for the other hints, Mohamed. You're right
      about tools continually evolving. No doubt in a year or two something will replace
      Vagrant, even.

    message: If you're into GIT repos with automatic deployment you might need to
      check GitLab and post-hooks. GitLab is a free opensource GIT repository wrapper
      with a quite neat web interface, just throw it on a 1 GB RAM instance from Linode,
      DigitalOcean or Amazon, and it'll do the job. Using post-hooks is a dirty way
      to do deployment, so if you'd rather go with Jenkins then you would actually
      opt the better option.

      chmod), but GIT's nice.

    message: Many thanks, Amjad. At this point I'm really just beginning, so a GUI
      interface like Tower (which is very nice also) helps me figure out what this
      all is. But once I learn the basics, I hope I can move on to doing more in the
      Terminal. It has many advantages, and I don't dislike the aesthetic. Above all,
      it's hard to beat command line for speed
