  Need your help guys,
  our customer needs the system to send notifications to system users on a monthly basis & based on other criteria/s (like when the user proposal deadline due date in 5 days, then send him a notification)

  I'm wondering what is the best way to do so in windows service (Timers, or scheduled jobs or what ?)

  P.S I'm using windows & developing with Asp.Net MVC
  Thanks !
