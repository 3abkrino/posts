  Need your help guys,
  our customer needs the system to send notifications to system users on a monthly basis & based on other criteria/s (like when the user proposal deadline due date in 5 days, then send him a notification)

  I'm wondering what is the best way to do so in windows service (Timers, or scheduled jobs or what ?)

  P.S I'm using windows & developing with Asp.Net MVC
  Thanks !

      but one of the things I've been told that this approach(using .net timers) is not good because it's affected by the OS date & time, so if you changed time it'll be affected or so
      the second thing is, it it really effective in case of long periods (initialize a timer that will run/elapse after a month or so ) ?
