      DNS is an abbrev for Domain Name System,
      it has two ways to work, iterative & recursive when resolve a site by its domain name, there is Local DNS as a first receiver then TLD up to the Root server and the work flow then depends on previously mentioned techniques, there is 4 types of DNS records: NS, MX, A and CNAME
      and its an application layer protocol and based on distributed DB, and can be attacked using DDos attacks or Redirect attacks for example man-in-middle and DNS poisoning  :D
