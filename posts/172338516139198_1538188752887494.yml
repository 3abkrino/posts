  مساء الخير

      I think it's better if you can put together a project that is well defined and useful for your company, it might not be a customer commitment or maybe a stretch goal that doesn't put so much stress over the intern, but you still give the sense of achievement when done.
      You can also just consider him/her a part of your team and assign work items, bugs and whatnot, it maybe a bit confusing if your systems are large and typically requires some time to ramp up, however it may be a relatively new project so ramp up is not that much.

    message: Our team decides a well defined project with milestones for the intern
      before he joins the team. Milestones gives the flexibility of what can be delivered.
      He doesn't have to finish all milestones as he's working in sprints and deliver
      something in each sprint (2 weeks). One team member is assigned as his mentor
      throughout the entire internship and works with him closely to deliver the project.
      The intern also attends our meetings so he gets very good sense of the bigger
      picture.
