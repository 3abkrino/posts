  Has anyone tried a paid membership on egghead?
  If so, how does the "watching offline" function work? Can I just download the videos to my computer?

      I didn't try it but I would assume it uses the fileSystem API, which basically writes the file to a sandboxed section of your local file system then read from it :)
