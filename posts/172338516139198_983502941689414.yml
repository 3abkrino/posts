message: "Hi there , \nI am a senior PHP Developer with 8 yrs Exp.\n\ni was called
  three days ago for a job interview i did not apply for (they get my resume from
  some website)\n\ni was asked if i used joomla before and if i write code documentation
  \ .\n\nI told the interviewer that i did not do any previous work with joomla as
  i always build Platforms and big systems from scratch and Most of the Joomla Bootstapping
  Core is an added load i do not need specially with big traffic sites ,\n\nthe second
  question about documentation , i said i never wrote documentation because i was
  never asked to , but if i would be asked , i can do this as it is a very easy job
  but a time consuming. \n\nwhen the interview came to the part where i should show
  him my code and my previous work , he was on a hurry an he just said i will call
  you .\n\ni really do not know why such people - calling themselves multi national
  companies - are not estimating the value of our time .. we prepared .. came in time
  .. postponed our duties .. why ? he could have asked by phone if i used joomla or
  made documentation before !!\n\nI do not think that all PHP programmers in FACEBOOK
  co. or Google inc. used joomla or Done the Documentation part before .\n\nwhat do
  you think ?"
