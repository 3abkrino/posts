message: "For anyone with experience in Networks, I was asked to completely replace
  an old PC that acts as a domain controller for a network with a new server, the
  old PC has a Windows Server 2003 while I installed Windows Server 2008 on the new
  one. \nI googled migration tools to migrate all the content from the old one to
  the new one and found ADMT but installing it on the old pc was a pain and didn't
  work properly, even installing powershell to run scripts that would migrate everything
  was a pain (probably due to the fact that someone installed a crack that stopped
  time on the pc so that the trial period would never finish and now powershell won't
  open because of date/time problems)\n\nI finally managed to copy the OUs and users
  and policies using different tools from one to the other. the question is .. Is
  there any way to move all the PCs in the network from the old domain to the new
  one automatically instead of manually doing it? knowing that most PCs use Windows
  XP and they're around 30 PC .. I tried simply connecting one PC to the new domain
  hoping it would find the same name and IP and work but it didn't"

      I dont have much experience in this, but I assume you setup a 2008 server, then you promote it to a DC and make it join the existing domain (a slave DC), it will replicate the 2003 master.
      Next step is to promote the 2008DC to become the GC, so 2003 will become the slave, then retire the old 2003 DC
      Summary, a domain can have multiple Domain Controllers, and only one GC (Global Catalog, that holds the users and groups info).
