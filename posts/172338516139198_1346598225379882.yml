message: So I'm trying to solve a problem. I have a point which can be a player, and
  I have several objects around, some are farther some are near er. I want to exclude
  all points that are farther and include the nearer using distances for example.
  How would one cluster or filter the objects. I'm thinking about spatial partitioning.
  The objects are in geographic coordinates. The number of objects can be 10.000
