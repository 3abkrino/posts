  Hi, I have a database of contacts that include mobile numbers with the old format, you know in 2011 there had been a shift in numbers format by adding a new digit. Are there a piece of software that can help me update the numbers automatically without the hassle of Excel tricks?

  I imagine there should have been a something to import CSV and do automatic update done. Anyone still aware of a software like that?

  Thanks a lot
