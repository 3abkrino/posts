  I have a table of events each with date and time. what's the best practice to send a notification to all users who subscribed to each event at the event date:time. what I did, for now creating a service to check the coming events and if event time == current time then sends notification and I keep this service running forever.

  My question isn't about notification itself, it's how to fire a notification action on the event date:time.

      Ahmed Mohsen Hassan you can use { Service Bus for Windows Server } that can handle most of these operation :
      • Create Topic and subscription according to your needs
      • insert message with event data at a specific time and allow subscriber to accept it only at a specific time
