    message: Price does not justify value, very bad after-sale and maintenance service
      in Egypt. For the price of a Mac air you can get TWO very good Samsung compact
      with better specs and all the freedom to install whatever OS on it.

    message: Get Macbook Air. Good thing about it is you can install both Windows
      and Mac OS (dual boot or virtual machine) which gives you more option rather
      than just having only Windows/Linux available (although you can still install
      Mac OS on non-mac devices, it's done through a lot of hooks and the OS won't
      be stable at all)

      Mohamed Elsherif Do you own a Surface Pro tablet? People say you can do all kinds of development work (including WP8 which requires a Hyper-V!) on it without any problems and even some gaming, how much of this is true?
      I'm really considering replacing my current 5-year-old HP laptop with a Surface Pro 3 (when I can afford it :D), but I'm still not 100% comfortable about this decision.

      I don't own any laptops, I am Desktop guy, for me portability is not important.
      All surface line uses Intel (i3, i5, i7) Haswell Processors which are very Strong especially (i5 and i7) and also comes with Intel HD 4400 5000 respectively which are good for gaming (casual gaming and some advanced graphics gaming) but it is not a gaming machine, if you want to game get a gaming console or a Desktop with a dedicated graphic card :)

      yeah my plan is to (one day) have Surface Pro 3 and a powerful Desktop at home for gaming (and remote desktop and being a home server keda).
      Portability is important for me, I like having a dev and gaming device wherever I am, and I'm getting tired or my bulky laptop woth its huge charger, that's why I'm considering the Surface Pro.

      I can find for portability - currently I used either my phone or Nexus 7 tablet,
      and for any serious computing (gaming, working, doing anything that requires
      bigger screen(s)) I switch to Desktop PC
