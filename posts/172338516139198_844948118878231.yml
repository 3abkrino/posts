  Android Studio can be linked with http://trello.com and mantis "bug tracking system"
  it allows you to create profiles ... i.e. when solving a certain bug or developing a certain case it opens only related windows and activate only certain breakpoints based on your settings .... This is pretty useful and enable fast developing and context switching between different issues ...
  I hope this info is useful, it was very useful to me
