  Been looking for a simple validation scheme for URLs in PHP, using filter_var reports URLs with Arabic characters as "invalid"

  I came across this article which studies several RegEx's and compares them against each other in validating all kinds of urls

  I think this is the most useful article about the matter I have seen so far
