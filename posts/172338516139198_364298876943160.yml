      The writing part is usually fairly simple, to know what to write is the hard part.

      The hardest part is to understand what the code supposed to be doing few years after it was written

    message: it usually starts out simple but I will be disappointed if it doesn't
      get exponentially difficult.

      that's definitely because you code-by-flow, not thinking about that you need to code and the separation and the different responsibilities involved.
      10 minutes thinking and organizing worth the whole day writing/deleting/copying/moving your code in order to get it organized.

    message: Coding AFTER thinking is way better thank thinking WHILE coding.

    message: I respectfully disagree, planning ahead doesn't make much of a difference
      except that it is in most cases, a waste of time. The key point is , in my  opinion,
      to never write bad smelly code. You would normally know smelly code when you
      see it, but to not write such code is a different thing, and anyway it doesn't
      have anything to do with pre-planning or thinking before coding. Actually the
      most effective ways of writing software is based on thinking WHILE writing code.
