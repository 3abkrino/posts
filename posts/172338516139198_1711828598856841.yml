message: "I am reading John Sonmez's Software Developer's Life Manual and the book
  is really good and I think it's worth reading. It isn't technical but it discusses
  everything related to software development. \n\nIn one chapter he talks about the
  differences you'll experience as a software developer if you worked for a statrup,
  medium, or corporate company. And how in a company that needs software development
  but not a software company there might be loose software development practices."
