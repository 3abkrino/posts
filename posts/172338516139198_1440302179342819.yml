  Hello Guys,
  I have a question regarding mongoDB.
  When should I seperate entities and build relationships between them like it's normally done in a SQL database and when I shouldn't?  For example Student entity and Course entity. I have learned that in mongo you should rarely seperate such entities so i should create a property for student that is of type array and put in it the courses that the student takes rather than creating a relationship (different scheme) between the student and the courses.
