  I'm working on web application php/mysql, every user has his own database, need to set virtual directories that would change database name,
  example:
  if user URL domain.com/support1/ the user database would be support1 and if domain.com/support2/ the database name would be support2 and files are in one folder domain.com/support/

  any ideas? can this be handled by .htaccess?
