  "I hate code, and I want as little of it as possible in our product. â€“ Jack Diederich
  On some of my most productive days, when I've felt that I've truly generated lots of value for my employer relative to my salary, the end result from an entire day worth of work was 3-5 lines of code . Other great efforts that I'm really proud of is removing thousands of lines of code from a project."

  Does everyone else share the same sentiment? I personally do find this notion of how many lines of code per hour to be fundamentally wrong but it's also interesting that I too believe the very best work days I've had in the past 10 years were spent removing code than writing code.
