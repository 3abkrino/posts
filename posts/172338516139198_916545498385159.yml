message: "Blocking the rendering of the content due to web fonts is disrespectful,
  annoying and unnecessary. Show content in fallback font first, load Web fonts later.
  And it’s not difficult to achieve either. Store fonts in localStorage or just use
  WebFontLoader: https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader. One-time-font-switch is
  OK.\n\nThere’s nothing more annoying than knowing that the content is already available
  but blocked due to heavy Web fonts.\uFEFF"
