  So, following what Adel Khalil did, let's add my post as well.

  I'm a 17 years old web developer, started UnliCrea around a couple of years ago. I worked on a lot of projects including the web platform for Concerned Joe and I released an opensource version of the whole thing. We self-fund ourselves by freelancing on oDesk.

  I got an internship at eSpace last July and right now I'm working on the project we were working on then. It's an iOS game made using Swift. It's also a clone of another game I created earlier using ActionScript 3 during NewGrounds Game Jam 9.

  There are a lot of other stuff to add but I'd rather keep it short. So yea, who'd like to AMA?
