  Good evening everybody,

  If I have a server which sits behind a firewall that blocks ports 80 and 443 knowingly that I don't have the power to configure it, and I need to get the server let's encrypt certificate. Is there any work around this?
  I searched but didn't find much.
  The error I am getting : "Failed authorization procedure. subdomain (http-01): urn:acme:error:connection :: The server could not connect to the client to verify the domain :: Fetching http://subdomain /.well-known/acme-challenge/KiFZt5REhi3vRUEyeIhrKzqipTI0h31QRlj-U99PAYY: Timeout"

  I replaced the full domain name in this post with "subdomain" string.

  Thanks in advance
