  Dear JS developers, I have  a question. What debugging files do you use? I had a situation where this was part of my code and Chrome didn't tell about the syntax error:

  // No semi-colon after "file_data"
  var file_data
  file_data = $(item).prop('files')[0];

  I switched to Firefox and it gave a hint about the missing semi-colon, but I wanna hear more about how do you usually verify your code?

  Thanks

    message: "First, semi-colons are optional in JS. So that's not a syntax error.
      \n\nIt just became a good a very well & established best practice to use them
      because of how the runtime will add semi colons for you (Google JavaScript automatic
      semi colon insertion or ASI) which can lead to subtle errors if you don't know
      how it works. \n\nTo catch these kind of errors use ESLint in your editor of
      choice. \n\nESLint can work as you want, so if you want to keep writing with
      semi-colons then it can catch if you miss any & also if you want to write without
      semi-colons it can tell you when this might break. \n\n\nFor example this is
      an opinionated ESLint config that works without semi-colons. \n\nhttp://standardjs.com\n\nAnd
      this another one that works with semi-colons\n\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb"

      I'm usually using 3 methods
      JSlint & JSHint & "use strict"; mode
      Those three should make you write clean and clear code.
