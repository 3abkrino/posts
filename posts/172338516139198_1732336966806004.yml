  After long usage of Unity,
  Surprised to have better performance using KDE Plasma !
  Although, Had bad experience with Gnome Shell and Cinnamon.

  Anybody faced similar experiences ? Any thoughts about reasons ?

  * Using Fedora 27 on Dell Inspiron 15R ( Intel Graphics Rev. 09 )

      Yes kde plasma has better performance than unity for me.
      But it is using more of the GPU% I guess it is all about hardware acceleration.
