    message: Startups hire engineers who can add value immediately, the most valuable
      asset for startup is time, how long they can survive before they burn out, this
      is why startups takes risks in many things but when it comes to web technologies
      and development of technologies they tend to choose experienced engineers who
      can deliver fast so that they could start generating revenue as soon as possible.
