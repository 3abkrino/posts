    message: I don't see any special requirements in what you say. I bet even a Galaxy
      S3 might do. If you do video recording, it'll help buying an expensive class
      10 microSIM with high write speed. Nexus will not allow that but you might be
      OK with big internal storage.

    message: my major requirements is to handle the 5000 contacts without any performance
      degradation. some with S4 told me that he had contacts less than mine, and he
      had an issue in the performance !

    message: 5000 contact is nothing. Android has contacts app that Sync your contacts
      to your Gmail I have over 12K contact and it's just fine. it doesn't affect
      processing or Ram Memory at all. go for Nexus, Samsung or iPhone any of them
      will not give you issues on what you need.
