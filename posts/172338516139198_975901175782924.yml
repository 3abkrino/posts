  Good Afternoon guys,

  I was asked to buy a good router for the company I'm working at, it's an advertising agency. I did some research generally speaking to choose what's best for the agency.
  I saw a number of models but I don't know exactly which fits best. (I am limited to maximum 1.5-2K budget)
  I need something with a good range which also accepts a good number of devices because the one we have here is limited to a certain number of devices.

  I was thinking about one of those:

  What do you guys recommend?

  Thanks :)
