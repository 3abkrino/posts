  Dear Geeks,

  I have decided to never pay any money for software ever again, I made this decision 3 years ago and so far have not paid a single pence or even paid any subscriptions to any service. All software I use is free software and I have nothing cracked.

  I have also not paid for any music whatsoever, and am looking for a way to get books totally free. I currently have no trouble getting the information I need and only once 4 years ago paid for a book online.

  What do you think of trying a simialr experiment? Please tell me your experiences/opinions.

  BR,
  MSAMY
