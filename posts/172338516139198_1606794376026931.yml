  I am working on a relatively large web app .. The UI is somehow complex .. I need the app to be SPA .. So to avoid getting lost in the future I decided to use Webpack to organise my project with either Vue/react ... I need working with the UI to be flexible and in a component based manner ...
  Do you suggest any of react/vue over the other ..
  Do you have any preference for a specific UI Framework to integrate with..
  I am also starting the project without a design .. Just wireframes and user stories , So in this stage my focus is on the interaction with the user But I have also to showcase a nice looking UI to the client until a designer joins me .. So do you have any tips to help me avoid problems when replacing the styles of UI components later ?
  ..
  A side question .. Is it reasonable  to integrate jQuery and bootstrap plugins into a webpack powered web app or it will have bad side effects later?

  Sorry for asking many questions but I am a bit confused

      Usually the answer would be use what you are more comfortable with , but here is the catch , react has a big issue regarding licenses.

      I would recommend vue.js (personal taste)

      very complicated to maintain in the future with so many developers working on
      it. \n\nSplit the app to different SPA so you can do releases easily and have
      different people working on it.\n\nWhatever technology you will use once you
      create the github repo add CI/CD (you will thank me for that later)\n\nGo away
      from jQuery if the app is for production. But if its only a wireframe go ahead."

    message: "If you are new to React, don't wonder if you find yourself spending
      much more time refactoring than writing new stuff. It takes a bit of time and
      effort, but it's really worth it on the long run specially for a large scale
      project. You should also use state manager/container like redux, flux, mobx..etc
      as this is almost a necessity if you want your application to scale well. \n\nHere
      is what I currently use in a current react project:\n- Styling: Styled Components\n-
      Routing: react-router + react-redux-router\n- State: Redux\n- UI Library: Semantic
      UI React\n\nOne last thing to mention is that if you are short on time, don't
      use Redux and use some less verbose library for state management because redux
      involves writing a lot of boilerplate code."
