message: Hey geeks, we're launching a new product "elmenus groups", mainly a real-time
  updated shared basket (using sockets) that we've been hard at work on, that we'd
  like to get your feedback on. If interested, you can send me an email at amir.allam@elmenus.com
  or DM me to send you access codes as it's still in beta. Check elmenus.com/groups
  for a full description.
