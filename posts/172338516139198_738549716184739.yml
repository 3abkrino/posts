      I don't think ISO 4217 and ISO 3166 are translated to any non-latin alphabet, it's quite interesting actually. I just searched for the Arabic versions of those and came up short.
      It certainly makes sense, I can't imagine a direct Arabic translation of EG or EGP.
      Maybe for instance, EGP could be ج.م
      But it's evident that EG wouldn't have a direct translation, given we have .EG TLD and a .مصر TLD
