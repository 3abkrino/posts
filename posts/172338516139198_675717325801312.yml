  Richard M. Stallman, Linus Thorvalds, and Donald E. Knuth engage in a discussion on whose impact on the computerized world was the greatest.
  Stallman: "God told me I have programmed the best editor in the world!"
  Thorvalds: "Well, God told me that I have programmed the best operating system in the world!"
  Knuth: "Wait, wait - I never said that."
