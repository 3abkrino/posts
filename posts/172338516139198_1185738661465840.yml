  General question that i hope it's not permitted and also hope that this doesn't sound stupid but i'm almost fed up!
  how can a freelancer without any full-time job get an actual stable job ?, maybe to narrow the answers possibilities my main concern is about how to implement your portfolio page into your cv ?
