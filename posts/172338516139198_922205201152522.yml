  I just published a blog post: "Flattening, or the quest to procedurally generating low poly art because my artistic skills are non existent"

  You may find it interesting if you like #programming, #graphics, #proceduralGeneration, #lowpoly art or... well... you have some free time :)

  Feedback is always welcome :)

  Diaa Sami & Ahmed Al-Amir might probably recognise this piece from before but hey... at least i moved to a more stable blog now :D
