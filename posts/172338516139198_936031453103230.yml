  Anyone using Linux as their main OS here?
  I'm moving from Windows and want to discuss some things.

      OK, here we go.
      First of all, I love open-source and I love Linux.
      The only thing that's been keeping me from switching to Linux for many years is some applications being not available. like Adobe products for instance.
      I'm learning Web Design and I use Photoshop regularly and I use Illustrator every now and then.
      But now I found that I can run Adobe CC programs on Linux using "PlayOnLinux" and "wine" libraries.
      I couldn't decide between Ubuntu, Deepin, and Elementary.
      But I finally chose Ubuntu because of it's popularity and customizability.
      I just installed it a couple hours ago alongside Windows 8.1.
      I hate "Unity" desktop environment so I decided to install Deepin's DE.
      But first I decided to try "PlayOnLinux" and test Photoshop before making any progress because that's the deal-breaker for me.
      It's currently downloading some "libraries" to install Photoshop and I have my fingers crossed so I thought maybe I'd post my experience here and get some advice from Linux veterans.
      Did I follow the right approach by installing Ubuntu and then changing the DE?
      What's the best DE out there in your opinion? from a design point-of-view I'm in love with Deepin's DE.
      I like the Mac-like app launcher and the Windows-like taskbar.
      I didn't try GNOME yet but I don't like how it looks like (side dock and such) though it's the most popular and it has many extensions and I'm a man of customization.
      What about Window managers, Software Centres, GTK themes, Music players?
      I'm pretty damn confused and don't know what to do so I though I'd just write this while waiting for "PlayOnLinux" to finish it's job.

      I'm using linux as my primary os since 2008. I've never tried running windows apps on linux (I don't like the idea, and I keep windows on the side for games and these very few apps) but I believe gimp and incscape should be sufficient alternatives. AFAIK, Deepin and elementary are based on ubuntu so it's a matter of personal taste. My favourite DEs are unity and gnome 3. My favourite music player is clementine. My advice is keep windows as your primary os now and do as much experimenting with linux as you can until you break every thing :D
      There's a point when you'll actually enjoy it and you'll find yourself less inclined to open windows, you can then move completely to linux.

      I don't encourage you to use Linux if you highly use Photoshop & Illustrator because it will be annoying with big projects.

      Linux is so great for development ..  But for design you have to get used to GIMP & Ink-Scape. & I am sure the transition won't be easy.

      Anyway, I predict that we will see Adobe's support for Linux in the next few years.

      Getting the Debian to see Nvidia is not so easy but doable if you have meduim
      level Google and configuration skills. Ubuntu is great if you are a linux newbie.
      Then use Virtualbox to install a windows VM that you only use for work and certain
      games. Linux has a very low footprint (400 MB RAM) so with 16 GB RAM and an
      SSD a VM would be quick and usable.
