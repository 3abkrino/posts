  I wonder what a Javascript developer do ? Is it another title for UI Developer ?

  And if not, Is this role even exists in Egypt ?

      I have been a  pure JS developer for a Year now. I'm originally a PHP develoer but I started writing JS applications for IPTV frameworks that run on linux based set-top boxes that uses SVG instead of HTML.
      I got stuck with this and PHP is slowly fading away except for backend purposes.
      Now, I'm kinda lost in a very ,VERY specific area and this sucks :(
      However, I love what I do because I've always loved JS but hated Photoshop, css and other Frontenderz stuff :)

      what you said..  There are no many places that have pure js developers..  Always
      with a front-end flavor?

      I didn't look to be honest. It started with a task that turned out to be my future career
      I didn't choose JS life. JS life chose me :D

    message: It's not Egypt specific. It's exactly as you guessed, another word to
      say UI developer, unless they work with Node for their backend, then they probably
      mean a full stack JavaScript developer, which is not specific to Egypt as well.
