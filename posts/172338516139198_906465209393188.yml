  yesterday i posted a question if somebody have stumbled on a website or a service that allow downloading a database such as what shodan is working on ,  by that i meant if there was a database with a complete scan to the whole ip v4/v6 of the internet , basically asking to be able to download the internet  :)

  as no answer was given i started to search (sure i searched before posting  , only this time i searched deeper ) and stumbled on a website which offer exactly what i was looking for  , a downloadable database of the whole internet  , so i though of sharing that also ..

  https://scans.io

  now my only problem is being able to download one of these databases  , the smallest one i set my eyes on is 70G , so wish me luck & long life  :D
