message: 'The important thing is to recognize this: If you are reading this or any
  blog, writing a blog of your own, or working in IT, you are probably in the top
  1% of the wealth in the world. It may not feel like it, but you are very fortunate
  and likely very skilled. There are a thousand reasons why you are where you are
  and your self-confidence and ability are just one factor. It''s OK to feel like
  a phony sometimes. It''s healthy if it''s moves you forward.'
