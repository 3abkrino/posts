  TLDR; I'm starting a Go meetup, if you are interested vote below.
  I've been using Go as my main language for almost two years now. I really miss having a good Go community in Egypt. That's why I'm starting one. What I have in mind, is to start with a workshop to introduce Go and prepare some problems for the attendees to solve. I built a tool specifically for this meetup, which I called Godge. It's an online judge for meetups and workshops. You can read more about the tool here: (http://blog.mbassem.com/2017/03/12/godge/). If you are interested please vote in the poll below.
