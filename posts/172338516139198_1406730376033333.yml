      I remember setting up a mesos cluster a year ago and it was very painful. Getting it to work wasn't straight forward and I was getting lots of exceptions and problems when I tried to use their toolings. On the other hand, my experience with kubernetes was very nice. I used a managed kuberentes cluster that's provided by Google Container Engine (GKE), so the comparison is not really fair. But I really enjoyed using kuberentes. The documentation is very nice and I didn't face any problems using it.
      It's not relevant to the use cases you are asking about, but that's my experience using both :D

    message: Well I thought of adding it to the comparison but I think Kubernetes
      and Mesos are more popular.
