      angular is a framework.
      react and vue are libraries..

      bas to make a statment reactjs is the most sophisticated js approach.. the learning curve is HUGE -matsada2sh ele bey2olak its easier than angular.. its not, and whom even claim so aslan msh fahem en react is a ecosystem. not just a library/framework u use

      so in a nutshell, if you have a near golive date, use angularjs, most documented, easiest to start off, and extreamly powerful.

      reactjs is the way to build something as big as facebook, bas u need to learn the ecma6+yarn+state management ecosystem, and its challenging will take years to master, so learn it as a side bas dont depend enak 7at3e3raf te go production beh law lesa 7atet3alem..

      angular ba3d ma2lab angularjs, i droped it, bas da personal choice/vengeance msh 3ashan howa we7esh.
