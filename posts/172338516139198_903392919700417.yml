  Guys, just a wake up call. I am mainly a lurker here and I do not post that much, but I am turning off the notifications from the group and directing my attention else where.

  It is not like Einstein is leaving the group of course, but a humble notification of how the group is turning into a trivial Q/A forum every passing day. It is like 10% geeky stuff and 90% "would you please debug my code for me?"
