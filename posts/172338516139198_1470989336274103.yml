    message: "Storing the actual files in the database just bloats your database,
      the only advantage is that you get backups of these files with your regular
      database backup, however you can still maintain the backup advantage while not
      saving the files directly inside the database if you're using FILESTREAMS in
      SQL Server, this feature uses the usual file system to store the files while
      keeping references in the database so they get backed up as well. \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/blob/filestream-sql-server"
