message: "Hello Geeks, \nMy Macbook unable to open certain websites (actually all
  domains  in my shared hosting). \nI cannot find a solution on any forums yet that
  work for me. \nThe issue has nothing to do with my Internet line, I can access those
  sites with no problems using my mobile device.\nNot sure what else I can try. Does
  anyone have any suggestions?"
