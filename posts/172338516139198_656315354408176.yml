    message: "I did have my nginx rule to force SSL and my app is working well under
      https (ror) but i had problem connecting to my socket server because my main
      app is under ssl and my socket is not. \n\nbut for expressjs and node I think
      you need to include the SSL keys in your server.js but i need this server to
      work on my local for testing :D"

    message: Contrasting with IIS, even for local testing you need a certificate.
      You can create a self-signed one, or get one from OpenSSL for free.
