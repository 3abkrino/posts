    message: Check with your bank; it's not a general problem. I just paid online,
      and I use PayPal regularly with no problems.

    message: "PayPal works with VISA CREDIT cards only (in Egypt) , so debits, prepaids
      or all master cards don't. \n\nIf you have a credit visa and still not working,
      ask your bank customer service to enable it for online payments/purchases"
