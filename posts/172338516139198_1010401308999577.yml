message: "We are teaming up\n\nWe are creating an App to help the refugees starting
  their new lives in germany. This app wil be helping over 800,000 refugees all over
  germany.\n\nIt is a very simple app to connect the people who need help \"Refugees\"
  with the people who are willing to help \"Volunteers\"\n\nWe collected the requirement
  from both sides refugees and volunteers and created an abstract layout for the app\n\nNow
  we need to create a demo app for the purpose of fund raising and after achieving
  our target we will continue with the development.\n\nWe are a team of three engineers
  and looking for other two enthusiastic volunteers s who can share with us  the same
  mission to ease the refugees lives and belive that,  technology is one of the best
  means to reach such a goal.\n \nWe need two active team players: \n\n1- An innovative
  Android developer\n2- A creative Graphic designer (adobe and flash) \n\nI hope you
  guys can help and may god help us to help those who in need for our help.\n\nThanks!\nDahy"
