      Let'sencrypt is free but needs renewal every 90 days.

      Also not all ssl are equal, if you need something for just one domain and with normal key length use a third party one it will cost you some money but it's worth it.

      Take care that your hosting provider may restrict you to buy certificates from them.

      If you have a vps, then you can use this tiny reverse proxy that will convert any http website to https with http2 enabled by default, it requires zero configurations.
      It uses lets encrypt and will renew the ssl certs automatically.
