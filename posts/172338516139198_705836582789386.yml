message: "Guys,\n\nI have two CSV database files with [email, first name, last name].
  I want to remove the content of a CSV file from the other one. \n\nStory: 10K records
  CSV email database, was tested for bad email, software only exported 900 records
  that's bad and should be removed from the original database.\n\nAnyone with experience
  getting this done, even using excel?\n\nThanks"

      So much hassle for a very simple problem. If the CSV data in both files are in the same order.
      Short_file.csv [email, first_name, last_name]
      long_file.csv [email, first_name, last_name]

      Then a fast-grep will do the job (Disclaimer, make backup copies first):
      grep -Fvf bad_users.csv all_users.csv > users_final.csv

    message: Abdelrahman Magdy it should definitely work without changes. Is the error
      indicating that it can't find the grep command or it runs but breaks with an
      error?

    message: Thanks Hady I managed to do it easier with Excel by embedding both files,
      highlighting duplicate records, delete and export. Couldn't get the command
      to run on my CMD.EXE for some reason.
