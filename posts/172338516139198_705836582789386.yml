message: "Guys,\n\nI have two CSV database files with [email, first name, last name].
  I want to remove the content of a CSV file from the other one. \n\nStory: 10K records
  CSV email database, was tested for bad email, software only exported 900 records
  that's bad and should be removed from the original database.\n\nAnyone with experience
  getting this done, even using excel?\n\nThanks"
