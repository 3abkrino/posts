      a distributed transaction system, but it's not a storage system of arbitrary

    message: "thank you for your replays \nwhat i need is to create a contract on
      the azure consortium blockchain to send file from member to another member the
      file'll be hashed \nnow I know that i can store data up to 8 mb on the block
      but I am wondering what'll stop me to do that like the cost of gas so what I
      wanna be sure about is \n1- is there any cost for mining when i use a private
      blockchain ?\n2-is it real that my storage limit on the block when I use private
      bc is up to 8mb?"

    message: 'Your private blockchain is your private blockchain. You are free to
      change whichever parameters you want, including increasing the gas limit by
      1000x or more. This said, you must understand why there''s an artificial gas
      limit in the first place. Keep in mind that every transaction sent to the blockchain
      is replicated on each node. If each node on your blockchain is capable of receiving,
      processing and storing significant amounts of data then you can increase the
      block limit to gigabytes. But most likely, what you''re looking for is a Distributed
      Hash Table (DHT) which is a different data structure from a blockchain but it
      works well alongside the blockchain. Major DHT technologies are currently torrents
      and IPFS. If you''re looking for a professional blockchain/DHT/P2P consultation,

      علي حد علمي
      you save only the transactions hashed on the blockchain, and then validate the hash to make sure, but to save a file hashed you can not decrypt it back, it is one way only, for the files/data should be saved on IPFS
