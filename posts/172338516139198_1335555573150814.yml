  Hi geeks
  I just want to ask what do you expect for virtual reality field future as jobs and maybe as startup ? Is it deserves risk to start studying at this field or it just wasting time?

      Well yes, VR is the future, but the future of what and when are the questions.
      Will everybody be playing VR games in their home in 2017? Probably not, since good VR Headsets are expensive and there aren't that many good games, we might have to wait 2 years for that.
      Will people be playing VR Games at VR Arcades (or VR Cybers) in 2017? I hope so ... my startup is counting on that :D
      Will VR be used in education soon? I think so yeah, the immersion will definitely help in education. Will it be used in certain kinds of job training? I think it will. Will it be used in advertising campaigns? Almost definitely!

      In order to learn about VR, you first have to learn how to use a Game Engine. Unity and Unreal have built-in support for VR. In Unity, you basically mark a checkbox (and pick the type of hardware) and now the game/app will work in VR! If you have an Oculus that's really all you need! If you have an HTC Vive though, you will need some extra code for the controllers.
      I would recommend you start with Unity because of it's simplicity and beginner-friendliness, and learn it from the official tutorials at https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/
      And if you need any help, don't hesitate to contact me :)

      Will it be a waste? I don't think so, even if all my expectations didn't happen, you will have still learned how to do things with game engines, maybe you could become a game developer :)
