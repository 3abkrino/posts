  I need to develop a mobile App (Android and IOS), and most of its functionality are based on Database-based operation (That will be easily handled by Web APIs), and in addition to that it needs to work with the mobile location services, and to show notification to user.

  I am highly considering Cordova for such Apps, especially that this App will be a copy of an existing website with the same features.

  I want to ask developers who worked with cordova enough, may i expecting some problems with Cordova with such app, that make it better to implement it as a native app?

  And is there any way for showing notifications on the app (that not requiring the app to be running to show notifications of course), without using Push notifications? And will it work normally on both Android and IOS?
  If not, does push notifications working well with Cordova on both Android and IOS?

  Thanks in advance :)

      Performance needed to be tested, Cordova is famous for performance issues
      It is more advised to use either native or PWA application, or at least one of the latest cross like ionic2, native script2, or react native
