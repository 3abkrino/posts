      MVC and Java for the Back end Hibernate for your ORM, with AngularJS2 for the
      front end.

      Hello. This is the organizer of the AngularJS meetup in Sydney, ng-sydney

      - Can I use Angular 2 in LTS projects?

      Yes. Several people in my meetup have been reporting using it for work in the last 2 months at least, including enterprise apps.

      - How about performance?

      This is one of the main features in Angular 2!

      - Is it stable?

      Not 100%. There are still some changes happening with routing and forms. Not too crazy to be deal breakers though, except yes, expect a few.

      Happy to take any further questions you may have.

    message: I would personally not have trouble building Apps in Angular 2 and would
      have it in the list of acceptable technologies, in any case, it is a JS client
      side framework, so I would use it to build SPAs of limited/meduim size for my
      organization, something that could be built in 2-4 2 week sprints with 3 devs
      in a team. Otherwise, if you are talking about a large monolithic Application
      with lots of business functionality, I would go for an older UI framework that
      has stood the test of time as most of my business logic would be in the back
      end/ middleware.
