message: Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of
  a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least
  daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by
  an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.
  Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems
  and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. This article is a quick
  overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its current usage
