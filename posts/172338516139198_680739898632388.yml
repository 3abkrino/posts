  GObject enables full object-orientated development in C, including object inheritance, polymorphism, and, to the extent permissible in C, data hiding.

  GObjectâ€™s object-oriented interface is implemented in part by a generic, dynamic type system called GType. GType allows programmers to implement many different dynamic data types through singly-inherited class structure.
