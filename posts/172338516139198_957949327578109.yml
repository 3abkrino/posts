message: "This is more on the beginner side of things\n\nThis is a cool website that
  contains a wide range of tutorials on Javascript and Node.js\n\nThe tutorials are
  interactive node modules with a challenge to solve for every step in the tutorial\n\nThe
  tutorials cover a lot of beignner concepts (Javascript, Git, Node.js) to intermediate
  (Prototype chains, WebGL, Web audio ... etc.) and more advanced (ES6, Babel) also
  it covers some server side frameworks like (Express, Hapi) and some front end libraries
  (React, Lo-Dash)\n\nI didn't use all of the tutorials but the ones I use are really
  good \n\nI thought I'd share with you this link, I hope it could be useful to you."
