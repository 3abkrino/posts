  Is there any Egyptian payment service that could mimic a credit card and works for international transactions not just local ones?
  Vodafone cash, for example, works for local transactions only, is there any similar service that works for international transactions?
  cuz apparently 17 year olds can only have debit cards that don't support online payments :(
