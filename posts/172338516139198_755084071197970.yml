message: "I just want to share with you a vey nice experience I had in this week.
  on the weekend I had the pleasure to attend Startup Weekend in Guadalajara, Jalisco,
  Mexico. the largest Startup weekend in All latin America. I had the pleasure to
  see Drones, play with them and I've got captured from air :)\n\nYesterday I was
  also invited to an Event in #Wizeline and I also saw Drones and this time it wasn't
  as a toy! it was for Mining, Agriculture and Solar.\n\nCan't Imagine if in the Middle
  East we start using these drones how much more efficient we can get. and how much
  money it will save us! \n\nJust wanted to share with you this experience :)\n\nHave
  a good day"
