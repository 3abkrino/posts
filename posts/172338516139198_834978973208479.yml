  wondered how the app generating a valid codes even my mobile is not connected to
  the internet ?\ni'm just guessing that the app is getting a list of valid codes
  the first time you authenticate your account with it and keep changing them randomly
  and when you are connected it sync with the service to update the used codes with
  new ones. is that true ???\n\nPST : i'm referring to this app exactly : \n"
