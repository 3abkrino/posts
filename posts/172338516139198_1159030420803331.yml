    message: If the passwords are not salted, bruteforce and dictionary attacks are

      y3ni :D If the passwords are salted, I don't think there's a thread as far as
      I know but I'm not sure to be honest.

      hear the same thing over and over from different sources, remember the ICloude
      problem ? , im still concerned about the technique ya gama3a bardo :) i don't
      think bruteforce is something to consider with such systems :)

    message: That's what I'm saying. If the password are not salted, they can be cracked.
      Dictionary attacks are very applicable. Bruteforce can crack short passwords.
      There are many users who use common passwords for their accounts. "12345678",  "qwerty",
      "zxcvbn". Mark used dadad y3ni which bruteforce can get in less than a second
      :D

      Here's the article: http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/twitter-hack/
      Twitter denies it (also they bcrypt their passwords anyway). TechCrunch says the website that claims this leak is legit is LeakedSource, where you can check if your credentials have been leaked, though I wouldn't recommend that; you'd probably search using more than one parameter (saying a username and a phone number, or your username and email, etc) so you'd be basically giving away data about your accounts that could help someone hack into them anyway.

      Also, recovering a password from a salted hash isn't impossible, it just takes a lot (A LOT) of time/resources per hash, depending on the algorithm/iteration counts/etc etc. But then again, there is no way they'd just magically recover 30-something million salted and hashed passwords overnight lol

    message: '"Based on information in the data (including the fact that many of the

      were collected by malware infecting browsers like Firefox or Chrome rather than
      stolen directly from Twitter. Many of the affected users appear to be in Russiaâ€”six
      of the top 10 email domains represented in the database are Russian, including
      mail.ru and yandex.ru."[1] and "There is no way that Twitter stores passwords
      in plaintext in 2014 for example. There was a very significant amount of users
      with the password "<blank>" and "null". Some browsers store passwords as "<blank>"
