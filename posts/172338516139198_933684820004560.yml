message: "Since I am sure you guys are interested in everything I install and can't
  sleep without knowing my latest news, I now also installed MonoDevelop, not because
  I need it to Run VSCode, but because after installing Mono Libraries I thought I
  might as well.\n\nNotice in the second picture how much RAM is being used although
  I am using Pycharm and Mono and Iceweasel with multiple tabs. \n\nThis is exactly
  why I really love the #linux platform and HD space consumed with all the software
  I installed, including the web server and Eclipse is still 4.44 GB RAM.\n\nI guess
  I can easily run this machine on a USB drive and take it everywhere.\n\nFor those
  who need physical proof I attach this pic"
