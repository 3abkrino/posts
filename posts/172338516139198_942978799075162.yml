  Hi Geeks :)
  did you face that issue during your work before.
  I am working on hybrid solution MVC 5 + Webform, for some reasons one of foreign team wants to use AjaxToolKit and when we upgraded our solution to framework 4.5.1 it fails so i did upgrade to latest version of AjaxToolkit and it returns to work fine again but now for some reasons which we couldn't understand it stopped loading!! and threw msg "Uncaught Error: ASP.NET Ajax client-side framework failed to load."
  I did a lot of investigations about that issue and even did upgrades for different versions of AjaxToolKit but still the same message appeared.
  Any help :(

    message: it looks liek its is a versions compatibility problem, you'll need to
      investigate all the libraries/projects versions and use the exact versions it
      was working well with each other.
