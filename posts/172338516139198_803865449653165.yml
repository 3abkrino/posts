  Guys I decided I won't just remove posts ... I will ban and block users too ... I am accountable for what I was assigned to and I won't let see some wannabes taking over this place.
  Thanks

      If you can blow his house up as well do it! :D

      Seriously though, you should not ban him directly, unless there is a warning or a clear set of rules to follow that he violated!

      Leaving it open for personal interpretations (even if all members agree on this specific interpretation) is pretty dangerous.

      That's my opinion :)

      في واحد عامل الجروب درس خصوصي، كل شوية يكتب شوية كود و ييجي يقول لك انا عملت كذا و ناقص لي كذا، اجيبه منين؟ اهو ده مثال صارخ لحتمية البان :D

      ممكن اقترح شوية قواعد للبوستات الغير مناسبة:
      1- اللي بيطلب نعمل له شغله، مثال: اجيب منين سايد بار نافيجيشن شكله حلو؟

      2- بوستات التيتوريالز الهايفة، من عينة اتعلم جافاسكريبت في تلات ايام و ربع

      3- الاعلانات المباشرة لمنتج/موقع ربحي

      عاوز أأكد على نقطة قلناها قبل كدة و هي ان الهدف مش التنطيط على خلق الله، و انما في اماكن تانية مخصصة للكلام ده، زي مثلا ستاك اوفرفلو، و الجروب لا يهدف و لا يقدر ينافسه من اساسه، يبقى ملوش لازمة تضييع الوقت و الجهد

    message: "Such theatrical display is uncalled for. It's within your responsibilities
      to carry out removals and permanent bans for members that display a potential
      threat to the community's fabric. No need to open it for debate, each of the
      admin members is selected carefully to fit a specific criteria, in layman's
      terms a good admin is a good judge of character, fair and not trigger hungry.\n\nPeople
      that get added and within a few minutes post an ad, I've banned and will continue
      to ban many of those as they come along. \nWarnings are mostly subliminal, should
      come in a corrective, constructive form. Most people get the gist and back-off
      from an unwanted behaviour.\n\nVery rare cases should require an explicitly
      clear ban warning, like the case of this lame series of posts by a group of
      wanna-be developers building a clone of bufferapp. They generated a lot of friction
      enough to force a couple of admins and myself to explicitly give out warnings.
      The warnings went into effect as well, sad as it sounds but necessary.\n\nThe
      dude that keeps posting about wordpress, displaying little to no will for learning,
      self-improving and contributing something worth the community's time shouldn't
      get banned, he got the gist after a few harsh but constructive comments and
      a couple of post deletions.\n\nOther cases that require clear corrective actions,
      banning being the last on the list are policy violations. Ads are prohibited,
      a clear spam behaviour as mentioned above demands a ban.\n\nOther cases (most
      of them) of an ad being posted don't require a ban until the offender has repeated
      that action multiple times. Other cases require patience, like job posts. A
      new system was put in place, stated in the policy yet people still post here.\nA
      few corrective comments and now any new job ad is removed immediately without
      warning or instructions.\n\nAnother case, that walked the gray line with me
      was automated posts. I've monitored someone post from an app, on a regular schedule
      4 posts on two groups without regard to the nature of the post and its relevance
      to this group and it was a violation of policy. He didn't get a ban, a clear
      explicit warning was given and the problem was resolved.\n\n All in all, I see
      little reason behind this post and this discussion. You've been entrusted with
      a responsibility because you're fit to carry it through. Do what you need to
      do to keep the community healthy but exercise self control, patience and due
      diligence.\n\nGood luck."

      I've raised this point before and I'll raise it again, due diligence is required from the administrative team on who joins and who doesn't. Check the profiles, sift through their history, see what are they all about. Are they catfishing, are they selling something, do they look spammy.

      Being selective on who joins and who doesn't will weed out the need to be selective on what's allowed to be posted and what isn't. Sadly as it appears to be, increasing numbers is a higher priority than increasing quality. By the time I get around checking the join requests, most if not all would have been approved without any proper background checks.

      I check profiles and posts for people who would like to join ... I check posts of the new members and try to detect if there's something weird about it that might require extra attention for future posts.
      Increasing number of the members should never be a goal ... Unless we want to turn this place into an annoying group that no body check.
      I may was misunderstood guys ... When I was talking about banning, I was talking about something similar to the profile I posted 2 posts ago.

      The statement "evaluate their questions" has a strong negative connotation without a proper context, so let me put a context.
      The group was intended and will continue to be a hub for experienced _professionals_ in most technology disciplines. These members are there to share their practical real-world experiences, things you wouldn't otherwise get from a blog post, a question on stack overflow or a tutorial.

      Things you need to interact with someone on a personal level to learn about.

      Back to your comment, about the only right thing you said, is that the group is for people "who don't know how to". The filtering efforts that have and will continue to take place, are to qualify the types of "how tos". In other words, if you're looking for how to track your wordpress analytics with a plugin and asking if anyone knows a plugin then you're at the wrong place.

      I'd rather see someone asking about a technical detail in writing a wordpress plugin, with another answering, sharing their experience from writing their own wordpress plugins.

      If it exists on Google, it doesn't belong here. It's a blanket statement, but in a gist it's quite true. If I can find it on Google, you can. Some people ask rather silly questions, but they display a clear indication that they did their research and couldn't find a solution. Others treat the group like "مدونة أبو رامي"

      On a side note, what's the correlation between "beautiful minds" and a "country club"?

      but they could be designers or even power users. This post and the one above
      could even apply to admins in this group so just forget it. Delete posts if
      they are not appropriate, otherwise just accept that not all people are the
      same as you
