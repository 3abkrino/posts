    message: Callbacks are commonly used when you have an asynchronous operation that
      should notify the caller about its completion

    message: Promises are a replacement for Callbacks to help you deal with composition
      of multiple async operations while also making error handling simpler in some
      cases.

    message: promises are only resolved once they can be used for smart caching or
      for cases where you might have multiple calls trying to execute same action
      which should only happen once
