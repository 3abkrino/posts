  I have a dummy question from a non networking expert :)
  Why there is nothing like a P2P tor network like torrents , where we have an app installed like "bit-torrent" that service as a mini Tor server and we all use each other PC to do the onion routing ?
  Is it possible, is it exist ?

  I do understand that the current tor supposed to be a p2p system , however i can't see my tor client do anything for the network ?

    message: As far as I know, every tor client is also a tor server, this is how
      p2p networks work, the network is made up of nodes, and each node is both a
      client and a server. Phone clients might be different though.
