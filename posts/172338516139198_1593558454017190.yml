      code" for him, so the code is a deliverable and is his right.

      It depends on what u agreed with the client, He hires you to export a software product and he has right for publishing it and you don't, he pays to you for that.
      Code should be with external price as it has your experience about your code structure,libraries, quick implementation and so on...

    message: it's all about price if the price low end so he can't get the source
      code but someone is paying 6 digit number or so he obviously paying this kind
      of money for a source code . and of course there are something else you must
      provide a maintenance contract if you won't give him the source code . Hoba

      Yes they should get the source code, with few exceptions.

      Does your code contain code/assets that they didn't pay for and could benefit from beyond this specific project?

      Did you offer them a lower price with the promise that you will get paid more later for maintaining/improving the app?

      In any case, unless you explicitly mentioned that the source code costs more, it's probably unfair to ask for more after the project, since their alternative offers might have included the source code and they wouldn't have worked with you in the first place.

      For custom projects, including the source code is implied, at least to the average client. I personally think the responsibility falls on the developer for making his offer clear.

    message: It's his source code. He paid you to write it because he found you a
      good fit for implementing a project or an idea he had. Many contractors/employers
      sign NDA before such projects which means you can't share the source code with
      anyone and that is totally normal for any freelance project (mobile/web) and
      it strictly means that you don't own the code you write..he does.
