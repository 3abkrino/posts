  SA,
  I need to generate a report (excel sheet) from a web app that doesn't support any API. I have no access to the web app's backend/database. I tried looking up the http requests sent/recieved using Wireshark, but I found so many meaningless parameters with meaningless values (This web app is written in asp.net). It's easy to do it manualy, you just check some parameters and then click on the export button, but I need to automate this. Any suggestions?

      extraction to be automatic? Or the user can click on a button?

      you can use this tool https://www.import.io/ if it's so simple
      or write your own crawler and save as csb
