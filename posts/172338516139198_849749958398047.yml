message: "Interesting book. You can download the PDF version for free.\n\nQuoting
  their site : \n\n\"Visualizing Information for Advocacy is a book about how advocates
  and activists use visual elements in their campaigns. In this 170-page book we explore
  how to influence issues using the right combination of information, design, technologies
  and networks. Through over 60 examples of visual information campaigns from around
  the world we show how they capture attention, present stories and take us on journeys
  through data.\""
