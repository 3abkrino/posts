  Hello Geeks, I know my question seems repetitive but I am getting interesting to work in freelancing. I am Android Developer comes from Web development (PHP basically). I haven't done any freelancing jobs before and I would like to know HOW and WHERE I can start.

  I would like to know:

  How to find freelancing jobs (potential customers)?
  How can you get paid for your work (payment methods) and on which basis (e.g, hourly or fixed price)?
  How can you build reputation and marketing your self?

  Any more advice or tips I will be so grateful.

  Thanks in andvance, cheers :)
