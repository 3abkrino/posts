message: Hey guys. People who moved to Europe for a new job, in your experience is
  it okay to ask for, say, an additional month before starting (and asking that a
  couple weeks before your initial start date)? I initially told them my notice period
  was 2 months and they gave me 2 and a half months before my starting date. But I
  don't feel ready yet to move there and would like to ask for a bit more time but
  I'm not really sure if I should do that. Thoughts?

      You should move if you're looking for a better quality of life, peace of mind and new adventures.
      Also, make sure that the salary is going to satisfy your needs with a little margin for your savings.

      plan well (like actually book the ticket) so your request is final and you don't
      keep asking for more extensions which will not be professional.\n\nAnd what
      do you mean by \"feeling ready\"? No one is ever 100% ready for such a big move,
      but you do what you can (objectively) and then jump out :) you can take holidays
      and come back to finish what you think was not ready, you know.\n\nGood luck

      I think you can extend a reasonable amount of time as long as it's justifiable. Visa process for instance usually takes more time than expected.

      Keep in mind, asking for extension is tricky, as it may gives the impression that you are no longer interested or waiting for another offer
