  Geeks after start using Mac OS X and start my development using Python and Django, I'm feeling like I took the red bill and I'm out of the matrix, I'm feeling I'm doing everything by myself  no more next next and wizards to get things done for me, now I'm living inside the Terminal.
  In nutshell I love this and this will be my primary development platform, I'm not saying I'll leave .NET and Windows but I love Unix systems and Python.
