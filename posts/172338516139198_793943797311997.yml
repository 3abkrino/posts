message: "I searched for a method to retrieve service tag or product model of a specific
  vendor \" Dell , HP , etc... \" device using command line and i found a command
  prompt , but this is achieved locally \nCan I encapsulate a packet with this information
  to a remote desktop of a website or something remotely without the permission of
  local administrator  or by just access this destination with the device ?"
