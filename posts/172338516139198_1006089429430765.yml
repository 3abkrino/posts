  Hello

  I'm working on some project that is mainly a social network and I want to use a SPA enabled framework

  I was digging a bit and found few options eliminated some and two were left

  1 the full meteor stack

  2 ReactJS on Rails

  Well actually I'm confused what to use

  i don't need all the fancy DDP and auto publishing with meteor and I think this would be a problem in scaling because of the sticky sessions
  ( not the fancy scaling ) here I get frustrated by the framework as its not agile friendly you should follow ur own methodology *atleast that was the result of my research*

  On the other hand rails and react are both perfect in terms of agile development .. I havent used react before but had a sneak peak at its features
  But here I'm worried the code may get more complex and I'm not sure if rails would do better than meteor concerning performance

  Need to know ur opinions guys and thank you!

      Big sites survived on well known technologies. Rails perf was an issue for twitter at some stage. When you get to that stage, it will be a nice problem to have. Don't  think about it now.

      Most successful websites have many parts of their code rewritten "several times", and their architecture revisited as well of course.

      So, don't worry about it too much. If you do, go with Rails. You can't go wrong with Rails.

      Repeating myself like hell: when Rails becomes the bottleneck, either you have done something stupid using it, or you (your site) became big enough that solving that problem becomes an investment you spend happily on a nice problem to have.
