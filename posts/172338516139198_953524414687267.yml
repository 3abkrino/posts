  PEP 8 is Python style guide. Style guides are good, but they are not enough to make you write maintainable code.

  This session discuss this. Although the context is about Python, Python style guide (PEP 8), Pythonic (beautiful) code, you can learn how to appreciate maintainable code in any language.

  On a related note, the yearly Python conference has many interesting sessions about many topics: performance, machine learning, home automation, scientific computing, etc. You'll find all of these videos in the same YouTube account which uploaded this video.
