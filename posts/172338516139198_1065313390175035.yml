  Major in Computer Science or Software Engineering?
  I'm at the third year and choosing my major for the next 3 semesters and I'm really confused about choosing it, I find Computer Science more interesting. However, Software Engineering more important.

  Those are the uncommon courses in each(not taught in other depts.),

  Computer Science:

  [Distributed Systems](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/ics/cs%20specialization/14CSCI07I%20Distributed%20Systems.pdf)

  [Compiler Design](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/ics/cs%20specialization/14CSCI04H%20Compiler%20Design.pdf)

  [Theory of computing](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/ics/cs%20specialization/14CSCI01H%20Theory%20of%20Computing.pdf)

  Software Engineering:

  [Software Engineering II](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/ICS/SE%20Specialization/14CSSE01I%20Software%20Engineering%20II.pdf)

  [Advance Object-Oriented Software Engineering](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/13CSSE01H%20Advanced%20Object-Oriented%20Software%20Engineering.pdf)

  [Software Development for Real Time Systems](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/ICS/SE%20Specialization/14CSSE03H%20Software%20Development%20for%20Real%20Time%20Systems.pdf)

  [Software Quality Assurance](http://www.bue.edu.eg/pdfs/ICS/SE%20Specialization/14CSSE04H%20Software%20Quality%20Assurance.pdf)

  What do you think is better for the market and for me as a developer and which am I capable of learning on my own?

      Your software engineering curriculum seems more practical, while the computer science's is rather theoretic.
      I'd say go for the practical major, that's what the market -at least in the middle east- needs, you can pick up the theory on your own.

      in Web development and that is all the knowledge you need to get a job.

      Computer Science of course is better if you want to have a solid base in computers in general. However Software Engineering is more practical in development career but those courses are not that hard to self learn.
      In my opinion go for CS because SE will be more way easier after that.

      I'm graduated form SWE 3 years ago ..

      its not the matter of practical or not...in software engineering you will learn how to follow SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) in depth, how to manage software projects, what is design patterns and which one you should follow based on the project requirements, How to estimate the cost...etc so don't expect much programming but u ill learn that for sure...I was looking for a software engineering position in Egypt for more than 3 years ! but u know what...i didn't find any! most of the positions i found in our IT industry in Egypt titled with "Software Engineer " but they were actually looking for a .net Developer !!!

      .
      .
      In the same time i'm a senior web developer...an working as a software developer although i'm graduated from SWE....I tried to switch to software engineering many times but unfortunately NOT IN EGYPT....

      Software engineering is very important for large scale projects to make sure that software products is following the standard and well written but this actually not the case in our beloved country !
