  Hello geeks,

  I have a project that requires data transfer between a desktop application written  with node-webkit and another application written in C#.

  The communication will be done throw files ( A file written by either of them is read using the other )

  the data must be encrypted in files. We use AES-256-CBC.

  The problem is that the resulting string from the 2 parties are not identical when using the same key and IV.

  Any one has any knowledge in this or has a working example ?

  I can provide codes if you want.

  Thank you
