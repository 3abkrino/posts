message: "Hello everybody,\n\nI need counseling regarding what to choose as elective
  courses in my master degree.\nI have two options for that and I am confused whether
  to be very specific or somehow not to keep all eggs in the same basket. \nI am very
  interested in networking and security how not all options do offer that. \n\nOptions
  I have:-\n1- Distributed systems\n2- Self-Organizing Embedded Systems (SOES)\n3-
  Advanced Channel Coding \n4- Mobile Networks\n5- IT Security in automation systems.
  \n\nPlease, prioritize your suggestions as I need some to be redundant. \n\nThanks
  in advance."

    message: "First it depends on which University you are purchasing your degree!\n*Egyptian
      Universities out of comparison *\nAs you are interested in Security, let me
      list three points\n1- security need practice more than certificates and exams\n2-
      security is  the best choice if you have the passion\n3-Security is  a root
      for many specializations \"Fields within a  field\"\n===about the other options
      ==\n1-SOES ( new growing filed) \n2- Distributed systems \n3- Mobile networks
      (not preferred at all)"
