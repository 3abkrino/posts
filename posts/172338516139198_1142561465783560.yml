  Hi
  is there anyone using UIkit,  and is there a strong reason to use it instead of Bootstrap , which is widely used and you can find support and templates everywhere
  Thanks!

    message: It depends on the project you're working on. I personally use Semantic
      UI because it fits my needs, also I'm not a big fan of Bootstrap's grid. If
      you need to use a framework for a big project, you can use Bootstrap since it's
      easier than other frameworks. If you wanna use a grid only, you can use a grid
      like Skeleton. If you want a lightweight framework you can use Semantic UI or
      UIkit.
