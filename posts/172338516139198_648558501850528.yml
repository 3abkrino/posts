  Next Friday ISA I'm giving a session about using Python on Google App Engine. I want to show an interesting demo. No blogs & no Northwind. What I've in mind is a map of garbage/road bumps/etc in Egypt, with social login (G+, but I can add more). Which one do you prefer? (Add your suggestion if not in the list)
  BTW no politics :)
