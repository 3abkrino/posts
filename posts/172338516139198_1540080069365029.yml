  When backend call index.html it doesn't show the root component so is there something to add to my angular code?

    message: I don't think these is the right approach, the normal way is that you
      have a back end point and then you call the API through service in angular,
      that's the right  way to connect angular with your back-end services

      You can do that through the 2 best approaches:
      - Either to use socket.io (using the functions emit & on)
      - Or to call an api through a service in your angular.

    message: "don't call the index.html of an angular cli project during the development
      environment it won't work, what you should do is to keep both the front and
      the back-end development separated and working in parallel.\ncalling the backend
      api from your angular app using the http module\nonce you finish developing
      the front-end use the command \n\" ng build --prod\" this will generate static
      files in /dist folder in your app directory\nuntil here you can host your angular
      app by itself and the backend by itself as well both isolated, or you can take
      the dist folder and host it within your backend by calling the index.html file."

      You can just use services to do the job in a right way with your functions (CRUD as an example), call your service from the root app file and the required component.
      Here's an example of using services: https://github.com/loiane/angular2-crud-rest/blob/master/src/app/users/shared/users.service.ts

      Go to Angular docs and find the way to link components with services each others.
