      Actually, Echo is not a framework, it's just a library handling the events and dealing with web sockets and using Pusher or socket.io as a broadcaster. Pusher is a paid service, so if you want it scalable and free you will probably use socket io and on your own server.

      A short series about it

    message: It sounf likr you are a bit confusing between frontend and backend, realtime
      is achieved by a client (on front) and ur backend(which can be any event based
      be).., socket.io for backend part is amazing and scale very good on my personal
      experience, best thing socket.io come with its frontend lib too

    message: If you want something scalable and could handel millions of users, build
      own on your own using something like socket.io, SignalR in case you're using
