message: "Hi geeks I would like to ask \nIf any one have experince with \nFPGA in
  ML like or some thing XILNX\nCPLD board or ALTERA Max based boards \nI flow many
  instructions to build but \nno result yet \nSo I decide to get a development FPGA\nKit\nMy
  question did any one try this approach in ML or any data processing task ?\n\nI
  also noticed that IBM using memory as NAND building logical gate to handle data\nIf
  I'm right i try this in IC 74SLOO\nOr any 74xxx Family it's 4 bit quad gate \nOr
  im totally wrong"
