    message: CSS is getting lot of hate cause it isn't science :) It's a bunch of
      hacks and methods you have to go through all of them and learn it "THE HARD
      WAY" :)

    message: By it isn't science I mean that it isn't like programming where you have
      set of rules and logic that behave exactly like what you expect no matter how
      many time you run it. A lot of factors affect CSS and rendering and here comes
      the frustration for many :) You have the global name space, anything can alter
      what you write ... You have a hostile environment -aka the browser- which people
      expect it to behave exactly the same no matter which verion is it ... Just like
      trying to run an HD movie on a black and white TV ... You have the cascade ...
      It's really hard to explain all that to a beginner :D

    message: 'You learn about floats then you discover that you have to clear it.
      You try to create 3 columns layout then struggle to get the background to stretch
      vertically till you discover faux background method. You spend hours wondering
      why element { height : 100% ; } doesn''t work as expected till you discover
      it will never work that way. You try to dock a footer to the bottom then you
      discover you have to apply certain markup and CSS to achieve that goal. There
      are lots and lots of hacks and workaround to get your basic layout to work that
      you need to understand before writing one line of CSS ...'

    message: |-
      Ahmad Alfy I still don't know why 100% height fails to work 99% of the times I try it :D
      Edit: Unintended coincidence/pun here, sometimes 100% works but shows scrollbars, so I make it 99% and it works :D
