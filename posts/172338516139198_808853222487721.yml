message: "i deployed asp.net mvc project through visual studio to a website hosting
  that support mvc and MS sql too  and restore a database backup successfully but
  there's some error in web.config file so the website didn't work properly related
  to database access but the project works fine locally\n\nand honestly this is a
  first time for me to deal with things related to deploy and publish project through
  website hosting so that i tried many things to correct the error related to connection
  string but i couldn't do that\n\nthis is the connection string after updated \n
  \ <add name=\"wa3enyEntities\" connectionString=\"metadata=res://*/Models.Model1.csdl|res://*/Models.Model1.ssdl|res://*/Models.Model1.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider
  connection  string=&quot;data source=SQL5004.myASP.NET;initial catalog=DB_9B2DF3_wa3iny;integrated
  security=False;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;App=EntityFramework&quot;\" providerName=\"System.Data.EntityClient\"
  />\n\nthe website hosting support review the connection string and told me that
  \ni should review the code to ensure that not  overwritten by any other script.\n\nbut
  it works locally without any problem so i didn't think that the error in code but
  in the connenction string but i didn't know it till now"
