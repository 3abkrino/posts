  Yesterday i tried to remove win 10 and extend ubuntu instead, but unfortunately the hard was formatted by fault.

  Now i'm using testdisk with high analysis to detect partitions again in hard sectors, and i can get them correctly , but i can't recover them using testdisk ...

  What is the next step after analysis ?
