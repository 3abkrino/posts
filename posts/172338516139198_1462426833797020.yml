  Any Suggestions for 50-Inch Screen Operations dashboard?

  I need it to support Cloudwatch, as well as 3rd party sources, as well as a way to script some 3rd party integration, without major changes "Minimal effort".

  I took a look at Grafana, it seems promising to my use case, Did any body use it before can give me some heads up about its caveats ?

    message: grafana is only for creating the dashboards. It needs a data source and
      this data source is what you need to support cloudwatch or 3rd party integrations.
      Some famous data sources are graphite and prometheus.

      Grafana is just a visualization tool.. you need whatever is going to process/store the data as well ..
      You can also check kibana .. part of the elastic stack .. it integrates with elastic search as the storage and logstash as the processing tool..
      So similar to grafana

      If all u care abt is dashboards .. why not create ur own using d3.js..
      It is so easy and lots of available options are in there.. not tied to any particular architecture or backend ..
