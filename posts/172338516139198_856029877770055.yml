message: "Howdy geeks ..\n\nI have been thinking about a good introductory paragraph
  entry to start with , but i wasn't satisfied with any of the entries i came up with
  so i decided not to waste your time and get straight to the point .. \n\nAm not
  sure if such a post fits in this group or not , but i will really appreciate ur
  help.\n\nCurrently am in the 3rd grade in the Faculty of Computers and information
  system - Assuit university , and i have been struggling for a while trying to determine
  what specific field should i focus on and what specific skills should i enhance
  to land a job ASAP (Which is at least as soon as i graduate).\n\nI have already
  tried quite some stuff , Lead the first team to join the ACM-ACPC annual contest
  from my university , We did pretty well as no training was provided , We were totally
  self-dependent (We beat the AUC,GUC beginners team though , Am sure we could have
  done better).\n\nAnyways i have also tried to get my hands dirty working with some
  technologies , developed some java desktop applications , did some Web-Development
  in native php also used some micro-frameworks and worked a lil with (codeigniter
  and laravel) , Thanks to Alaa as he truly helped me a lot.\n\nUsing technologies
  is fun when everything works out pretty well , but it's pretty boring compared to
  abstract problem solving , specially optimization problems and AI..\n\nCurrently
  am getting used to the .NET framework , Working on a timetabling software for my
  faculty's semester timetables , In which am learning new AI techniques that i wasn't
  familiar with before (Ant colony optimization - Genetic algorithms - Graph coloring
  etc .. ) and also learning more about the .NET framework and C# (as i have chosen
  it to be the language am using for developing application for the .NET framework)
  .\n\nSo the problem is i really almost got no clue about what are the requirements
  of current employers and what should i do to land a job more quickly , Specially
  landing a job that isn't boring that it's only about implementing stuff for a specific
  framework or platform with no much thinking or problem solving involved , it would
  be just about getting used to that specific technology and acquiring more knowledge
  about flaws that might occur and bugs/problems that might show up later , Which
  is quite boring i guess. \n\nI really want to describe the position where am currently
  standing right now so you guys could provide the most efficient tips , but i guess
  that won't be easy right , Also i don't want to waste your time anymore ..\n\nSo
  in a nutshell what do you guys think i should be doing for the next couple of years
  before graduating taking in consideration that i might want to land an internship
  next summer , Thanks A LOT in advance , I totally totally appreciate your help ,
  Sorry again for wasting your time."
