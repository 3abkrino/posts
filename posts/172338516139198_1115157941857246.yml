  Trying to get a reliable anti-virus, firewall and security suite for my PC. I had McAfee LiveSafe and it's wonderful till it expired. I read online, from CNET, that Norton Security is the best. What's the current best security suite? I don't mind if it's paid for, but free of course is much better.

  Thanks ahead

      Windows Defender ... really
      (or if you're on Windows 7, then Microsoft Security Essentials)
      basically, the best antivirus is yourself, and if the user isn't careful then no antivirus will ever keep him safe.

      Windows Defender scored really bad in AVs performance. I don't trust Microsoft in anything, given the performance of its flagship Windows 10. If it weren't for the MacBook prices, I'd have already moved to Mac.

      I've read Norton and Kaspersky are the best. I've installed a trial of each, and it seems Kaspersky is better and more lightweight on the resources. However, it has done something wrong with my Wi-Fi... Worst case scenario, I'll move to Norton and call it a day.

      Unless someone here has a better alternative

      Are the scores you checked for the new Windows Defender (which is actually Security Essentials with a different name) or the old one in Windows 7 and Vista? Because last time I checked, Security Essentials was very good on benchmarks.

      Both Norton and Kaspersky really slow down your PC, specially if you have a normal HDD and not an SSD.

      In the end, to me, any bad antivirus is good enough, and as I said, even the best ones can't save you if you are careless.
