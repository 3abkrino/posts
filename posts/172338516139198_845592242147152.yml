  How do you explain to your clients a bug like this ? This is basically breaking all the input elements on the internet that use the same value for height and line-height ...
  Do you use a workaround to fix it? (using padding and decrease the line-height for example?) or you just say we will wait for a fix which is supposed to arrive in a month or less?
  I am not seeking technical solution ... I am asking about how to handle the client.
