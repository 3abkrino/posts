    message: If you are willing to pay, New Relic might be the best option. It's mainly
      for performance analytics, but it has nice realtime analytics features, and
      they support .NET webservices.

    message: Otherwise, you are probably going to depend on IIS7+ require monitoring
      or Advanced Logging Module, or bake something on your own of course.

      It's not hard BTW.

    message: Another option, many .NET hosts will provide you with SmarterTools license.
      SmarterStats might do a good job for this (I assume).

      Google Analytics can be called by server-side scripts, and they put a sample on their website. I will rewrite it & post it as a python library on github (hopefully :) )

      The rest of the options are great, but they are a lot more than I need right now, and my app is not in .net ;)

      As I mentioned, it shouldn't be hard. Good luck.
