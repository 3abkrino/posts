    message: "Thanks a lot man it worked like a Charm :D one more thing please. so
      i have a table in my db called queries where I save mysql queries.\n\nthen I
      have a model that take this query and run it on another DB and return the results.
      \n\nthe thing here is that if you have a working query ex: \nSET @id = 15;\n\nSELECT
      * FROM (`users`) WHERE `site_id`=@id;\n\nand when i try to run it $this->db->query($queryCont);
      return $query->result_array();\n\nError Number: 1064\n\nYou have an error in
      your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version
      for the right syntax to use near 'SELECT * FROM (`event_meta`) WHERE `site_id`=@site_id'
      at line 2\n\nSET @site_id = 100763; SELECT * FROM (`event_meta`) WHERE `site_id`=@site_id;\n\nFilename:
      /Users/mohamedalaa/Sites/mailing/app/models/query.php\n\nLine Number: 62"
