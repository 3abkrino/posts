      There are lot of sources on the internet that can help you start , for examples coursera and edx have some good cypersecurity courses , also there is cybrary which is dedicated to teach cybersecurity

      That said i have an opinion - which people can disagree on - that cyber security is not really a beginner field as is that you don't just go from nowhere and start learning cybersecurity but either it is a field based on strong knowledge and real hand on experience on multiple fields such as networks , operating systems ,  programming , etc .

    message: Yasmine Zakaria the question should be answered in a different a way
      , there are tens of cyber security jobs available today. Before starting any
      course, you need first to know what do you wanna be after few years from now.
      The most famous job is penetration testing but there are many others , like
      threat intelligence mentioned above, malware analysts, secure coding, SOC Analysts,
      Security officer, Compliance and auditing or like the people love to say it
      GRC,...etc and many others. So, your first step is to understand every job description
      well and see which track you wanna take because cyber security is a really big
      sector now with many types of jobs

    message: "Cybersecurity has many fields, you should start learning to think like
      a hacker first. Try to break any system you find, think of the edge cases that
      the programmers may have missed. Think from different angles and perspectives.\n\n
      There are multiple fields you can specialize at, but if you want to be a Mr.Robot,
      you have to understand how operating systems work, how memory is managed, What
      are cpu registers used for, How code execution flow is handled. You have to
      understand the different layers of OSI most importantly Transport Layer, Network
      Layer & Application Layer. \n\nSorry if I overwhelmed you, but hacking is all
      about having knowledge and thinking outside the box. My advice to you is: \n\n-
      If you want to learn pentesting web applications, start with reading about SQL
      Injections, XSS & File inclusion vulnerabilities\n- If you want to learn pentesting
      binary apps and discover the next heartbleed! Learn about Stack & Heap overflows,
      learn about exploiting off-by-1, Learn assembly, Learn the stack, learn the
      heap, learn the memory.\n- Read as much as you can, read the classics (shellcoder's
      handbook), (The webapp hacker handbook)\n- Solve challenges & wargames to get
      you started (hackthisbox), (DVWA)\n- Read all issues of Phrack (phrack.org)\n-
      Read existing exploits (exploit-db.org, packetstormsecurity.com)\n- Learn nmap\n-
      Learn tcpdump / wireshark to sniff the packets travelling within your network\n-
      Learn metasploit\n\nAnd most importantly, Be Patient, this doesn't happen overnight,
      it's a journey, so just enjoy it"
