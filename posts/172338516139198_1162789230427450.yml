      Toptal malyana nas 7afza mesh fahma, including "senior engineers". If you can cope with that, Its pay will be good relative to employment in Egypt.

      The interview process starts with an HR call, followed by a coding test that is very similar to a topcoder SRM, followed by a live technical phone interview that's also an algorithm test, followed by a mini project that you have to deliver as if it were requested by a client.

      I heard they have "Regional Rates", so you can not for example charge as high as a resident of US or Canada.
      Is that true? What is the average rate for developers form Egypt/Middle east then?
