  Let's say I want to redesign gurustop.net
  Not make a totally different design but extract brand colours and create a brand identity that I can build on later for other pages / websites
  While on it, fix small glitches (like how the padding above title is not the same in all pages, etc) by having better structured WordPress theme files and CSS (possibly based on bootstrap).

  Where would I go to get this at reasonable price (since I'm an individual running a family on single income, trying to squeeze this until I can create something profitable, and then invest more in it using profits)?

  Well, what is a reasonable price anyway?
