message: "Hello guys, \n\nI made a web application for downloading Pluralsight course's
  videos.\n\nThe main functionalities are:\n1- Downloading videos without depending
  on other applications(e.g. IDM).\n2- Be able to save entire course videos in a folder
  structured way with order.\n3- Display the number of raters of a given course which
  is not displayed on Pluralsight website.\n4- No need for valid subscription for
  free videos.\n\nYour feedback is highly appreciated. If you think it's illegal,
  kindly tell me."
