  ==========
  I built Notedn.com two years ago

  i built it for personal usage at first , then i developed it to be a public online service

  it was takefastnotes.com at the beginning, it was in arabic and english interfaces and for notes only

  a year ago i developed it to a new only english version , added (Taskbook) feature and planned for two more features ( codebook ) & ( linkbook ) , but i never had time to do them ,

  do you have any advices about the site because i think about taking it down :(
