message: Dears,currently we are creating a form generation for medical application
  and sure data and schema is very dynamic , so we are thinking to work with NoSQL
  database to store the information as it is document based and schemaless , what
  do you recommend MongoDB or CouchDB ? is server management for these dbs is complex
  as the deployment could be over intranet or shall i go for Amazon Dynamodb and force
  them to work over internet (Which in some cases could be hard )? your recommendations
  are highly appreciated
