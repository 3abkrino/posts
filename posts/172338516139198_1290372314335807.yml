  is anyone here hear before about "Skill up program" as they are trying to simulate ITI Program and making tracks just like ITI program in some centers.
  the idea is self study with mentors with 1 session per week for 6 months period.
  Now they request 200 LE per month  instructor fees for 4 sessions + 80 LE for center fees and the only way for paying is through vodafone cash, no receipts.

      I know the founder of skillup personally and I can guarantee that he isn't the
      one who needs to steal your money. \nSo don't worry about money at all."
