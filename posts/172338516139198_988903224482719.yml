  Hello Geeks,
  I faced a statistical/probability term in data science field which i cant find its  mean, the term is "log bilinear".
  i know what is exactly meant by log linear which described nicely here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_model
  and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_analysis
  also i found a question here with no  real answer   http://www.quora.com/What-is-a-log-bilinear-model
  and also this http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/157136/log-linear-vs-log-bilinear

   Geeks help make it clear to me ...thanks in advance
