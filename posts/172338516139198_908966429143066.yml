    message: So, here's what happened, they sent me an email about malicious attacks
      going to default remote desktop port, and had a guide on how to change it. I
      had an unmanaged VPS (they have managed but Id didn't want to pay extra). I
      changed the port and then I couldn't login to the server.

    message: I checked for support and it's $50/hour to do stuff that require logging
      in to the server because it's unmanaged. I emailed them, and 5 minutes later
      they email back, done, we sorted out the firewall thing for you.

    message: This same thing was posted on twitter and facebook via buffer. I care
      about tracking my reach on twitter especially. I made sure this matches the
      exact tweet.
