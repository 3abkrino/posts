    message: In practice, you can not. People will always take source code when they
      leave. What you can do is write scary statements in their work contracts of
      what will happen if they steal source code.

    message: What about a local GIT repository like atlassian bitbucket accessed via
      local hosted VMs which can be remotely access having a strong internet/intranet
      & file sharing access restrictions ?

      even if they already have the source code they will never open it again. *Maybe
      this is me only* \U0001F644\n\nIf it is logic, you can seperate the application
      to multiple components each has its own repository"
