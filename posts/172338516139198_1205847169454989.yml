message: "I have a domain on name.com. I've changed its nameservers on 13th August,
  3 days ago. Unfortunately the old cached addresses are still used by DNS servers.
  It's very rare for a NS cached record to last for 3 days. Any clue? \n(Note that
  I use DNS lookup tools not only the local browsing)"

    message: Yes it is so rare, did you tried to access it from TOR Browser or from
      a proxy, to make sure that the new NS are in action? otherwise i do recommend
      doing the same action again, change the name servers and save.
