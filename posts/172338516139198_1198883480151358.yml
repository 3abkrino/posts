  Published many updates for apps published on Google Play.
  But, Till now can't figure out why some updates get processed fast, while others need hours or maybe days ?
  E.g.: Last night pushed updates for 2 apps, one got processed before this Morning, and the other till now still being processed !

  Anyone have more information about what processing depends on ?

  Tried to contact them but got no ways but sending e-mail, and did, while their expected reply is within 2 business days !.
