    message: yeah but, having just two factions, soviets having no air control and
      every unit having just one mode of attack (instead of two) is pretty boring
      :D (I used to play RA2 with the Eagle Red mod so Soviets can get basic air units
      :D)

      echoing in the background, that's when you know things are about to get serious

      Ahmed Mahmoud: True, they actually had to make the Kirov and the Apocalypse Tank weaker in RA3 3ashan el balance :D

    message: Ahmed Mahmoud no offence, I don't mean you, but many people are paid
      to pretend to be geeks, or PR people who are paid to pretend to love their companies.
      As for real geeks who love technology for the heck of it, not many of those
      these days, and I personally have met none
