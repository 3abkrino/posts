    message: I will go fro a web app but I need to know if azure is like linode ,
      digitalcloud , and godaddy servers .. or it has different infrastructure and
      different documentation ?? I need a good documentation url .. I've searched
      the MVA but I did not find anything useful for learning about azure from A to
      Z .. I've watched some videos they are good but for specific tasks and needs
      .
