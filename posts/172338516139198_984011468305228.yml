  Hey geeks, I have a question..

  If I've developed some project to someone and he asked me for the source code of this project, do I have the right to say no?

  And what about this scenario in enterprise-to-enterprise situation?

    message: Agree that it is based on Agreement, but I don't think hiding the source
      is an option any more, I think the agreement should be made immediately to include
      the source code. The days of proprietary software are coming to an end.

      Muhammad Even distributing the source code doesn't equal the right to produce and resell or claiming ownership of it, all these are separate rights, you can't claim the ownership of Linux source code, and you can't sell it either without adhering to the license.
      So bottom line is the License is everything, if you want to grant rights to someone, it has to be explicit in the license, even if the source code is open, doesn't imply other rights.

    message: 'Mohamed Elsherif true, but Free Software: you can modify, refactor,
      resell, rebrand the sourcecode as long as the output is free software. I can
      own the Linux source code and so can you in the sense that we can take it, modify
      it, brand it, sell it, we just can''t make it proprietary, that''s the whole
      idea.  With enough Free Software around, there will be no  reason to close the
      source code any more'

      couldn't have been free without having licenses like GPL, LGPL, MIT, BDS, Apache,

      to the end user.
