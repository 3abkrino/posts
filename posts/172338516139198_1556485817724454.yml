    message: consider using jwt, you won't need to store the token ... you will validate
      it with a token secret stored on the server

    message: well you can always encrypt them with openssl with your private key and
      decrypt them whenever you need, so a hacker will need to have access to you
      DB and also get your private keys from the server in that case to be able to
      use these access tokens

    message: If they are per user, why don't you keep them in client and retrieve
      them from local storage, so that they are not stored centrally in your backend.
