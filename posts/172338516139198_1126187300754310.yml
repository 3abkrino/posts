message: Hi guys, I have a problem in setting up my ubuntu laptop with an external
  LG monitor using an HDMI cable. The audio playing through the monitor is high pitched
  and faster than usual. I know it is a software problem because i have dual boot
  on my laptop and on Windows the same cable/same monitor works just fine. I read
  that it is a problem in Ubuntu (I am on 14.04) because of difference in sampling
  rates, I tried some stuff but didn't work out. Anyone had this problem before?
