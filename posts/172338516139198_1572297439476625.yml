  I am a little bit confused, 2 days of researchers to find a way which I can implement a pptx viewer to a webpage , add some more customizations and track the pptx progress.
  no thing offering all of the project needs.
  I am just want to present the pptx into the front end, with a progress bar of 100%, next prev buttons and no download available!
  is that impossible?!
  or any APIs or services which can help?
