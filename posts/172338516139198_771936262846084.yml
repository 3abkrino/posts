  I'm not delighted after i saw the new Google visual guidelines called material design, ridiculous name btw!, i feel it childish, cartoonish one!
  specially the dull 3 new bottom buttons. i wonder how big companies like ms or google have disastrous design teams??! i admit that apple design guys are superior compared to those on both companies
