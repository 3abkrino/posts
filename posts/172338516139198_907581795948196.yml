  I wanted to have a private git repo, we use github at work, and I saw the private pricing which was 7 usd for 5 private repos
  https://github.com/pricing
  checked bit bucket and it was similar but by users
  https://bitbucket.org/plans/

  I found gitlab, they offer a pricey enterprise edition, I expected the free edition to be shitty but I was surprised that it was more than perfect for my needs.
  the only issue that it was raping my ram :). but it's still cheaper solution than github/bitbucket as the only cost is the git server you're running
