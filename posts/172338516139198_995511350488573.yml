  Hola Geeks,
  I need your advice, more like guidance or experience.
  I'm currently on the track for a Bachelor's degree in software engineering but I suck at software design and architecture.
  Every time I'm designing a software I don't really know what to do to best design it, I know some design patterns and practices but It's never enough, what would you advice? What would be a good exercise or a project to learn from? Any valuable resources you know of?
  Thanks.
