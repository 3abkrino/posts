  Hello guys,
  Does anyone here know what does Raycast need to hit gameObject in Unity3D ?
  Search says it need a Collider but it didn't work for me...

      Can you paste your code somewhere?
      Because yes, a raycast will hit any collider, just notice that normal Physics Raycast will hit normal Colliders only and Physics2D Raycast will hit Collider2D only.

    message: Doing Physics manually that way can get very annoying as things usually
      don't work correctly on first try, you just need to keep trying and debugging
      and maybe even visualizing what's going on (there are functions in Debug to
      draw lines and stuff that could help) :)
