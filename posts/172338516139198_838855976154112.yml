  In past few years, an experiment started by some researchers to track the importance of google in our life, so they asked everyone if they can get rid of google? and if they can .. how long they could switch to another temporarily search engine?
  can we remake this user experiment here? then share results ..

    message: I'm already using duckduckgo.com go most of the time. I think duckduckgo.com
      might be implicitly using many other engines including Google's but at least
      I'm using it anonymously.
