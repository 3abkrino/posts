  We are starting a new meetup group in Cairo for those who are interested in DevOps. The first meetup will be on the 5th of September and will be about server monitoring. If you are interested, we would love to see you there! And you can consider this post also a call for speakers for the next meetups :D
  For more details, check the meetup description.
