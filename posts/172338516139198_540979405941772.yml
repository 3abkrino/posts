  Encrypt/Decrypt Using Base64 Or Cipher Only (Mix Them) \n2- Don't Check The Equality
  Of The License Using If (Use Switch)\n3- Don't Make The Check Of License Offline
  (Use API)\n4- Don't Send/Receive Plain Text Over The API Calls (Encrypt All)\n5-
  Don't Store The License Info On The Machine (Store It Online)\n6- Don't Calculate
  The Trial Period Based On User Machine (Use The Server Time)\n7- Don't Publish Your
  App Directly After The Final Build (Obfuscate It)\n\n• This Based On Personal Experience
  Throw The Last Week While Am Trying To Reset The Trial Period Of Some Visual Studio
  Extensions , And Failed ! :D"
