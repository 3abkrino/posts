    message: At Affectiva we use zoom  rooms or zoom meetings https://zoom.us/ we
      pay for them and we usually don't require vpn. We have an office in Cairo and
      another in Boston and the communication happens between the two offices. To
      be honest there are some cutoffs but they are mainly due to the cairo internet
      mainly.
