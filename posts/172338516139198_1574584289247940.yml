    message: Hi. I live in Germany, while not in Berlin, but I know the salaries quite
      well. In Berlin generally the salaries are a bit lower, but the rents are also
      a bit lower than other major cities. The salary really depends on the company,
      so HERE and Rocket among others are paying well. Then there are many small companies
      which don't pay so well. For a lead role, I'd expect at least around 70k per
      year.

      and regarding equity, it means nothing. It's a nice bonus if things go big, and they rarely do. Your main source is always salary. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13426494

      and this doesn't only apply to Berlin of course.

      I live in Berlin, I agree with every word Mohamed Shaaban said.

      I just want to comment about living costs, Its really very subjective and depends on your lifestyle. I know families (parents + 2 kids) who spend about 350 per month while others (same size) spend around 1000. It really depends on your lifestyle. In other words, you can control it.
