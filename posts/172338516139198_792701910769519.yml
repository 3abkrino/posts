message: "Hey everyone, my laptop (lenovo z570 with a couple of upgrades) is failing
  fast (in terms of MB failures, outer chaises ugly screen resolution.... :D), and
  I believe it's about time for a new one. However, the issue is, with my second gen
  core-i5, 8GB of RAM, and a recently bought Samsung SSD on my current system, I'm
  generally satisfied and most of the available laptops I've seen don't really look
  like a true upgrade. So, I started considering a Mac Book Pro... and then I started
  wondering if there are better choices that I can buy for >15K. I'm pretty sure the
  PC world has a lot to offer for that price range. so, simply put, the question is,
  why should/shouldn't I buy a mac, and if not a mac, which laptop do you recommend
  for running ubuntu (sorry windows guys, unless I'm running OS X, there is nothing
  else I can use other than Linux :D) \n\n--p.s. I know it's a controversial thing,
  and some people take it so religiously, but I need to buy a new laptop not start
  a flame war :P"
