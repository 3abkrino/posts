      reason behind this is that we are using technologies that's not supported in
      IE. not our fault is the fault of Microsoft

    message: Actually most desktop browsers identify themselves as Mozilla (one of
      the first internet browsers), then you'll find that the rest of the user agent
      string identifies it as MSIE. Just search for MSIE in user agent string.

    message: my issue is that we block IE < 9 users but the thumbnail generator websites
      are getting blocked as well. after doing a small research I found out that they
      are using Windows Server 2003 64Bit so i enabled it. and issue Fixed :)

      All browsers do it BTW, including Chrome.
      Read details here:
      http://www.quora.com/User-Agents/Why-do-non-Mozilla-browsers-include-Mozilla-in-their-user-agent-strings
      Mozilla doesn't refer to the Mozilla corporation in this context, as explained in the answer.
