  I saw a creepy trend, Like instead of being a developer or sw engineer, or QA Engineer "Engineer in test", I see now a C# Developer or a .Not Developer, and even more radical like ASP CRM Developer or Share Point 2012 Developer and yes he he specifies a version..

  What wrong with people ?

      Stupid HR people who know nothing about software engineering yet they think
      they can come up with a "Job description " similar to ones they come up with
      to an accountant or a salesman

      nothing is creepy in that , the fact is the base is one , but it's hard to be all in one
       i started with java for a few years then i turned to the dot net, yes the c# is typical to the java in the codding , but in the technique  they are totally different, i can't call myself a java developer unless i go back to follow what happened in the last 9 years with the java
      it can't be one man show

      There is nothing wrong with saying, I am a developer specialized in C#, Objective C ..etc

      This is how it goes now.. if you want to be a universal developer, then good luck :)

      with his tools, .NET can solve some problems better than Java, maybe Python
      can solve problems better than .NET, you who has the choice to use which framework

      better developer.

    message: Emad Mokhtar Habib I agree with most of what you say, but there is a
      big difference between someone who has never done any SP development no matter
      how smart and someone who has 3 years of SP experience. Same with Joomla, Drupal
      and DNN. Yes you can always learn a new framework, but if you must hit the floor
      running , then you must be an expert already
