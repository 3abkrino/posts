    message: "all the showcases and tutorials of the Responsive designs present it
      like it's only a change in css depending on the view port while it depends more
      on the behavior on each device for example you can adjust the view to show your
      app/website on TV but the behavior vary from TV to xBox or iPad. \n\nI'm preparing
      to write a good article but i can do it now as we are working on a secret project
      to fix this issue. but you can see this article and i will try to find good
      resources for this subject. but i'm more than happy if we can Hangout and discuss
      this out over the weekend :)\n\nhttp://blog.wapple.net/responding-to-responsive-design-and-why-it-fails-for-mobile/"
