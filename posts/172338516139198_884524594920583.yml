message: "A boy was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and \nsaid,
  \"If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess.\" He bent \nover, picked
  up the frog and put it in his pocket. \n\nThe frog spoke up again and said, \"If
  you kiss me and turn me back into\na beautiful Princess, I will stay with you for
  one week.\" The boy took the \nfrog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned
  it to the pocket. \n\nThe frog then cried out, \"If you kiss me and turn me back
  into a \nPrincess, I'll stay with you and do *anything* you want.\" Again the boy
  \ntook the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. \n\nFinally the
  frog asked, \"What is it? I've told you I'm a beautiful \nPrincess, that I'll stay
  with you for a week and do *anything* you want. \nWhy won't you kiss me?\" \n\nThe
  boy said, \"Look, I'm a computer programmer. I don't have time for \ngirlfriends,
  but a talking frog is really cool.\""
