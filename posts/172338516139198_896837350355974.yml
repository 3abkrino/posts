  I  have a complex issue :(
  currently we are working on hybrid solution MVC + Webforms.
  I did a master page that holds both MVC views and traditional web controls.
  It works fine, but there are some controls in the .ascx files not working probably!! when i click on button in .ascx controls it did not hit its click events!!
  Did anyone see that issue before?!
