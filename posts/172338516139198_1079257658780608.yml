message: I need to buy some bitcoins (0.15 BTC). I live in Alexandria and I would
  like to pay in cash or using vodafone cash. I tried to browse localbitcoin.com but
  I couldn't find one in egypt accepting EGP with enough trust score. If any one knows
  a trusted trader who he tried before please let me know and give me his details
  and thanks in advance.

      There is Omar Khorshid, I haven't bought from him personally, but I know people who did and say he's fine.
      You could also post on Bitcoin Egypt Users Group, you might find someone willing to sell.
