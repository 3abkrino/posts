      If I remember correctly, you just need to push a view matrix.
      To make the camera rotate you'd have to pop the view matrix, recreate it with a new rotation value, then push the new matrix.
      and BTW if your scene has just once object, rotating the object will be the same as rotating the camera but in the opposite direction :D
