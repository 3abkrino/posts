  I am used to debian on servers and desktop,

  I changed my host to Amazon EC2, I have a question

  Anyone used Amazon Linux ?  what it's like ? I heard it's based on redhat does the tutorials apply if I am stuck ?

  Amazon Linux or Ubuntu ?

      Why not let an Amazonian answer you?

      Well, with Amazon EC2 you have plenty of Linux-based images that you can run for your instance. Some of the instances will be very basic and so light and you can find others that are pre-configured for if you are going to use it for web development for example. You can search for those pre-configured machines using this term "Amazon AMI" + You can make your instance that you configured yourself an AMI machine that people would use too.

      Amazon have many Linux-distributions to use such as CentOS, Open Suse, Ubuntu & Redhat =)
