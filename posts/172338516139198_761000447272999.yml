      You need to learn Object oriented because it's common in any language in the world. then learn the syntax of this language and as Ahmed Commented you will need to practice a lot.

      I've seen some people who make a repo and make an app a day with the language they are learning. https://www.openshift.com/blogs/day-15-meteor-building-a-web-app-from-scratch-in-meteor

      Well, I don't know if I know enough of the language to be writing apps :/
      I think I am somewhat familiar with object oriented having used javascript a bit, but I want to learn Ruby now so...you know

    message: Yes, I'm Sure because this is how I learned ruby by doing real (live)
      apps. and this is how you learn any other language by doing stuff and  building
      cool apps. i think reading a book is not as efficient as practicing by hand.

    message: there is no anxious in programing you wanna get things done do it by
      hand. unfortunately universities make us more academic and not apply stuff in
      programming it's different. Good luck.
