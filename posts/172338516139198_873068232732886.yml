    message: "they've just replied with this mail \n\nHello,\nI'm writing in reference
      to your Stack Overflow account:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/users/2441473/alaa-attya-mohamed\nWe
      noticed that a substantial proportion of your posts seem to exist only to promote
      your product or website. Per the help center:\nBe careful, because the community
      frowns on overt self-promotion and tends to vote it down and flag it as spam.
      Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your
      product or website, so be it. However, you must disclose your affiliation in
      your answers. Also, if a huge percentage of your posts include a mention of
      your product or website, you're probably here for the wrong reasons. Our advertising
      rates are quite reasonable; contact our ad sales team for details.\nAny type
      of \"astroturfing\" promotion is not acceptable. It brings down the overall
      value of genuine recommendations for everyone on the site.\nIf you can stay
      within the above guidelines, and offer questions and answers of genuine benefit
      to the community which happen to mention your affiliation or product in context
      -- and with full disclosure -- then your future contributions are welcome.\nRegards,\nAndrew
      Barber\nStack Overflow moderator"

      an issue and it's not promoting anything. I'm not an affiliate to Github by
      any means and hopefully you can provide a resolution to my case.
