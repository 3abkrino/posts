message: "I need a Real-time collaborative tool where I can teach someone some HTML
  and CSS and the code would be debugged in front of us both. \n(And yes, I tried
  google, but I don't need it for JS and RUBY, I only need it for HTML and CSS) \nExample:
  codebits on http://www.codeacademy.com  (but this one isn't Real-time)"
