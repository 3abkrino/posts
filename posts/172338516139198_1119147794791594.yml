message: "We all saw people sharing there WhatsApp public key on the internet and
  people started to wonder if this is safe.\n\nWell, it is totally safe to share your
  public key, this is how Public Key Encryption works. Your public key is shared to
  the world and your private key must be kept in the safest place. \n\nA lot of technologies
  depend on Public Key Encryption. For example, the https certificates. In your browser
  you will find several certificates for major companies. Actually these certificates
  are the public keys. In fact the public key of google and facebook exists in all
  the browsers in the world, while the private key is the most top secret in these
  companies. They even have special hardware equipment to store it.\n\nIt takes sometime
  to understand how it works but it is essential for any programmer to understand
  this concept. I suggest watching the following list of videos from khan academy,
  it clearly describes this way of encryption in simple and interesting way\n\n"
