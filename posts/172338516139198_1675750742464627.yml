  Hello Geeks,

  Currently, I am moving from a company to another one, but I have an option to continue in the old one as part-time.
  I have to send an email request for this position also to match and manage my time between both companies.
  It will be my first time to do that so wants to know somethings like how many hours should I give them, how many days per week and how to match with my old colleagues to avoid miss-communication as both companies have the same core hours!
  What should I avoid and what I have to do?
  Thanks guys.

    message: In my personal experience you will need your full power and focus every
      time u switch jobs, so your full time (new opportunity ) job should be your
      number one priority, avoid overlapping hours , agree on a certain number of
      hours per week  (ex :20 hours/week) without committing to specific daily hours
      ( so you would always have the weekends as buffer)

    message: I agree with Nader, but I think 20 hours/week is really maximum and difficult
      to keep every week. 10 to 15 hours is more realistic. I also suggest to make
      most of the time over the weekend and keep minimal hours during weekdays for
      communication only. Try to keep communication to remote (email, phone calls,
      video conference, etc...) Your brain needs to rest everyday otherwise you will
      burn out and have sub-optimal performance in your new job. Take care!
