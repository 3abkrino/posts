  i'm switching to a new web hosting provider, and i need to transfer a 12.8 GB website backup to the new web hosting, of course this process with my internet speed in egypt will be a kind of suicide for me to download then upload 12.8GB via FTP.
  i thought of using AWS cloud machine to do but my freetire is not valid anymore. any ideas ?!

    message: Are you able to compress these files ? if you can, then you can direct
      download them on the new server. Just zip them, put them in a reachable link,
      download on the other side. Don't forget to delete after download.

    message: If you have ssh enabled on both servers you can use scp to copy the compressed
      file to the new hosting. If you only have ssh on the new server, you can put
      the compressed file on the old hosting in a web-accessible location (inside
      www directory for example) and use wget command on the new hosting to download
      the file.

      If you have SSH on both machines You use Rsync with compression enabled to mirror the website.
      The beauty about using Rsync is that you can mirror changes in the source web server only, you won't have to start the copy process from the beginning !
      Example one way mirror command :
      rsync -avz --delete --progress --stats /local/path user@remoteserver:/remote/path/
