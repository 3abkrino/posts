      I just want to make it super clear: this is an individual saying please for other members to do something. No one is to feel obligated by this request or think the group has new rules.

      While of course it's always a good idea to make sure more people understand what you write so that there is a point in writing it, this is left to common sense and we do not force you to do anything about it.

    message: I think it's a good idea to not go crazy with acronyms especially when
      they are not that common. If it makes it harder for someone in my target audience
      to read what I wrote and get what I wanted them to get, then it's my failure
      not theirs to deliver it.

    message: On the other hand, if you are using really common or industry standard
      ones that most of your audience should be able to get and / or search, then
      -unless you need to revisit these assumptions- your usage is OK as it excludes
      non-targeted audience.

    message: i agree with Mohamed Meligy , if its common or at least unique .. no
      problems in searching it .. but if it is mysterious and have many clones , it
      will be hard to find what is meant ..
