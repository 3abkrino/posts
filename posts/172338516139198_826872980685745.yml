  If you are holding some realtime online event or so that targets developers in the U.S., which timezone / state would you optimize for?

  Where the main criteria I think is getting the timezone that would suit the state(s) that have the most developers

    message: I guess Pacific time is OK. It is the time zone for the whole West coast
      of US which includes the Silicon Valley and Seattle and Portland and other tech
      cities, and it is only 3 hours difference with the east coast anyways for cities
      like NYC or Boston.

    message: Well EST is the official time of US since its the timezone if Washington
      DC most events and media programming goes with this time and the rest adjusts!
      But i'm kind tempted to agree with Mohamed Elsherif that it's safe to use PST
      since it's the tech time :)
