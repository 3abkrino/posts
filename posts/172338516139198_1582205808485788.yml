      You can make one using Arduino pro micro , super easy to make just upload code to Arduino from https://github.com/jerwuqu/ardoducky .
      You can get Arduino pro micro or Leonardo from future electronics , Uge-one or your favorite provider

      you could also make one yourself using an arduino
      arduino leonardo is the easiest

      but i did it before using an UNO (requires additional special steps tho)
