    message: If you're going to run Ubuntu anyway then go with the XPS, Ubuntu doesn't
      support some of the Mac drivers, but why you're thinking of Ubuntu on a MacBook?

    message: I have XPS 13 with Ubuntu and I like it. The Macbook Pro (not the latest
      version) is highly rated too but people usually buy it because of MacOS, so
      if you don't want it then there's no point in shelling out that kind of money.
      And I agree the SSD is the single most important component so be sure to invest
      in one.

    message: in my opinion, If you're going Ubuntu anyway then go for the XPS,  in
      Macbooks you pay for both the Hardware and the Software. And if you're not going
      to use MacOS anyway so it's going to be a waste.

      I don't recommend XPS. It has heating issues. I had XPS 15 inch before and sold it after a year.

      Mac book pro is fantastic but if you gonna run Ubuntu it's waste of money
