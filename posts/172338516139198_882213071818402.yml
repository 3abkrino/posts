  Is anyone here using Umbraco CMS or Orchard CMS, I've read a lot about both, but can't decide which one to use
  both are built using the same concepts (Content Types etc.)
  both are used by Microsoft
  So is anyone here used any of them to tell us his story ? and why he chose one over the other ?

      I've used both from a few years ago (orchard from around 2 years, Umbraco from 3 years) my short answer is: go for orchard because customizing them with your own developed components was a pain, but a little bit snappier with Orchard.
      another reason to vote for orchard is that it's developed using MVC pattern, so the concepts were easier to be applied.
      Please note that I didn't use any of them since that time, so my judgement is based on my personal experience.

      I appreciate your answer but I think the latest release of Umbraco brings a lot of major breaking changes.
      Also Umbraco uses Razor in almost everything as I think.
      You can have a new look at both now, and tell us what's changed, specially in architecture.
      Thanks :)

      Umbraco is much more mature, and has a good community, Also DNN is good option if you want something free and working with asp.net forms,
      If you have a budget I recommend Kentico my fav one

      Mohamed, I hate DNN :D
      I really hate it :) this is why I'm searching for another CMS.
      Could you please tell us in more details why do you prefer Umbraco?

    message: "I did't say I prefer them , base on you question , umbraco is better
      in their architecture , community is very supportive , they are using angular
      in backend , petapoco as ORM , which I prefer as DAL \n\nyou have to search
      more, there are more options\nLike mojo portal , Composite 1 , kooboo"

      I already did a lot of searches, and decided to narrow the search to both CMSs but can't decide between them, Also almost all comparison articles are very old, hence not realistic. So, I decided to ask developers who use them directly.
      Thanks for you answer :)

    message: Umbraco has a much bigger ecosystem. There are design agencies that specialize
      in creating CMS sites with it. There are a lot of paid plugins for it to do
      different things like ecommerce and more. Orchard is a very small niche.
