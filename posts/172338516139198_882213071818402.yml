  Is anyone here using Umbraco CMS or Orchard CMS, I've read a lot about both, but can't decide which one to use
  both are built using the same concepts (Content Types etc.)
  both are used by Microsoft
  So is anyone here used any of them to tell us his story ? and why he chose one over the other ?
