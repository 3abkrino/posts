message: "Another funny story I have heard about developing a POC and innovation\n\nSS:
  We need to develop a POC for a new product idea.\nTA: So what is the idea?\n\nSS:
  We want to build an engine that analyzes what people say on social media\nTA: Analyze
  what exactly?\n\nSS: Analyzie if they are saying good things or bad things about
  a specific topic\n\nTA: But that requires research and knowledge of lingusitics
  as far as I know\n\nSS: No, it's been done.\nTA: by who?\n\nSS: by 5 big multinational
  companies\nTA: and we are supposed to compete with them?\n\nSS: Yes, we  need to
  do our own implementation.\nTA: And how much time do we have to do this?\n\nSS:
  One month.\n\nTA: But what languages are we targetting?\n\nSS: English and Arabic,
  we can add more languages later.\n\nTA: In one month, you want an algorithm and
  an interface that shows graphs of the analyzed data?\n\nSS: Yes.\n\nTA: But what
  about the Algorithm? We need to do research, we could need computing and storage
  and bandwidth.\n\nSS: This guy in IT says there are 2 guys who implemented this
  on the internet.\nTA: What 2 guys?\n\nSS: 2 guys in MIT for their masters thesis.\nTA:
  So 2 guys in MIT spent maybe 2 years working on something like this, and you want
  me to understand and implement and compete with other coompanies in a month?\n\nSS:
  It's not that complicated, I am sure there is code on the internet that does it.\nTA:And
  I suppose the MIT guys only handled English, so in 1 month I am supposed to do Arabic
  as well?\n\nSS: That is our deadline.\n\nTA researches for a day.\n\nTA: I did some
  research, obviously this is extremely complicated and even the most basic algorithm
  to do this would have like 10% accuracy.\n\nSS: No we need to say that it is 70%.\nTA:
  Excuse me, how on earth are we gonna do that?\n\nSS: We can do a POC and keep improving,
  nothing is impossible.\n\nTA: Impossible and unfeasable in timeframe are pretty
  close.\nSS: No, we must burn the midnight oil and do whatever it takes.\n\nTA: But
  what your asking makes no sense whatsoever. Couldn't we just integrate with an engine
  that does that? and sell the customer a solution that actually works instead of
  doing something we know will be very low quality and will never meet his expectations.\n\nSS:
  No the solutions are expensive, it will be cheaper to develop ourselves.\nTA: But
  in 1 month we will have a very low quality solution with very low accuracy if we
  have anything at all.\n\nSS: No, if we focus and work hard we can have something.\n\nTA:
  But only  5 companies do this all over the world with any reasonable accuracy and
  2 guys at MIT did a Masters thesis in 2 years. If working hard for 1 month could
  have achieved that, wouldn't that make the multinational companies and guys at MIT
  stupid?\n\nSS: We have a customer request and a deadline.\n\nTA: If the customer
  asked for a ladder to climb to the moon, would that make it possible?\n\nSS: We
  have a dream and we need to pursue it.\n\nTA: You have a dream to make a sale, I
  want to actually have a realistic goal, otherwise this sounds like a disaster.\n\nSS:
  You need to be innovative and brave. \n\nTA: And smart? And realistic? \n\nSS: bla
  bla bla"
