    message: "The FileReader API is only available as of Safari 6.0 http://caniuse.com/filereader\n
      \ \nSo, no, unfortunately since Apple dropped support for Safari on Windows
      I do't think there is a way to get it to work \"as is\".  \n  \nHowever, if
      it's important for you to have this functionality in all browsers, you could
      test for the availability of the FileReader API:  \n\nif(window.FileReader)
      {   //do this\n} else {\n   //the browser doesn't support the FileReader Object,
      so do this\n}\n  \nThen, if it is not supported, you could POST the file via
      AJAX to a simple PHP/ASP.NET/RUBY script, which would then echo back the contents."
