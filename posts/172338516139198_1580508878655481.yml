      Your code isn't automatically copy protected, you have to patent it.
      Or, somehow prove that you wrote it first and then they stole it.
      Even then, it is a lengthy, costly, and complex process to win a copy protection lawsuit.
      If you wrote the code, then most like you are the better programmer, improve it, update it, bug fix it, and make a superior product than the one they stole.
      Most the time pursuing these cases isn't worth it.

    message: "U protect ur code by providing a license and proving in court u published
      it first and proof 2 codes are related... This is a very rare case anyway...
      No one care about code as much as idea's, unless its a code of full system/module
      then u can prove its urs easily. \nOut of personal experience: i took it to
      court before and egypt laws protects u to large extent tbh, but this topic is
      very broad"
