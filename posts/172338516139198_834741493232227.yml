      Facing bugs is a lot better than getting stuck for months in building a layer that people already have collectively built, enhanced and solved bugs for.

      And you will end up having bugs yourself, but this time you will have wasted your project's time building a data access layer instead of building your project!

      The ones I like are SQLAlchemy for Python and Doctrine for PHP, but the list is HUGE! You will need to do your own research :)

    message: There are many good alternatives. Back in the day NHibernate was the
      king, but now Entity Framework has grown "good enough" that I see this less
      and less. Some people use micro ORMs like Dapper and Peta Poco and even Massive
      but it's easier to manage EF in large scale.

    message: I'd say don't use the migrations feature though. Can be a pain in large
      team, not very merge friendly (in source control terms). Use something like
      DbUp or FluentMigrator, etc.

      Strongly recommend PetaPoco, it was selected in very large open source projects, which all trust, like umbraco & DNN.
      Personally it's my main Tiny ORM

      and became a big fan of NHibernate and threw a lot of weight in its community.
      Now EF although not great is very good for so many cases. I used it successfully
      in several projects. \n\nMigrations are not there still, they improved but main
      problems remained. Micro ORMs are improving greatly, but by definition or even
      name they are not for big teams. \n\nSo, yes, this area of the world has been
