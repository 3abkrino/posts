  Why MS Word saves a huge PDF files? even the file doesn't contains any image and just pure 3 pages text the results are 400 kb PDF file!

  Does anyone know a good converter from docx to pdf and it must converts the document properties and the bookmarks?

  I can use any virtual pdf printers but none of them are smart enough to write the document properties or the bookmarks (headings)
