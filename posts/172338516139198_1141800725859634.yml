    message: I haven't used the board you mentioned before but you are most likely
      to find that board -if it is being sold in Egypt- by checking where the likes
      of Raspberry Pi and Arduino are being sold in Egypt, this can be done by googling
      "raspberry pi Egypt" and/or "Arduno Egypt"

    message: Concerning the RTOS, i haven't seen an official thingy being developed
      -and maintained- for RPi or Arduino, however, some googling reveal some attempts
      at porting and old personal projects, nothing shiny though
