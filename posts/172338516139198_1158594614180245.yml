      For small projects, Currently I use SSH plus a deployment script. Whenever there's a new version I SSH, pull and run the deployment script which will move the config files, restart services, rebuild the main app and restart it. I'm not really comfortable with this because of the pain of maintaining this script.

      I used jenkins for deployments before. For small projects it's an overkill and you'll still need to write the deployment script.

    message: And with configuration files I mean those of nginx, supervisord, etc.
      Not the application specific config file.
