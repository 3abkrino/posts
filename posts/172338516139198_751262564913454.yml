message: "jsonwatch is a command line utility with which you can track changes in
  JSON data delivered by a shell command or a web (HTTP/HTTPS) API. \n\njsonwatch
  requests data from the designated source repeatedly at a set interval and displays
  the differences when the data changes. It is similar but not isomorphic in its behavior
  to how watch(1) with the -d switch works for plain-text data."
