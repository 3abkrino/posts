message: "A designer or UI developer who use Dreamweaver and Photoshop to design.
  \nThey deliver HTML that looks like this:\n<p>Hello, Alan</p>\nThen I add my AngularJs
  templates, like this: \n<p>Hello, {{username}}</p>\n\nNow if they need to fix something
  in the HTML layout, they have to run a fully fledged server with Angular, backed
  by DB, etc. Just to be able to test it with normal looking data.\n\nQuestion: Is
  there a way for a designer to deal with HTML templates without having to run a server?"

      Well, IMHO you have 2 options:
      1. Removing {{username}} and add some dummy static data to test the UI with
      2. *preferred* Having a test environment which is a lightweight server including mocked data
