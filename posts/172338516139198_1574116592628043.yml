      حسب الي انت ناوي تعمله
      لو vps هيبقي ويندوز مظنش هتحتاج Panel
      لو لينكس يستحسن تنزل Panel ولو الفلوس هتكبر منك ممكن تنزل Cantos

    message: You don't need cPanel, you can use Webmin, free and super nice. Take
      the chance to get familiar with the command line more, because if you master
      that... no panel is needed at all really.

    message: It depends on your requirements, for multi website hosting you can go
      with WHM/CPanel (cost about $14-$15/month) or Plesk (about $6/month) or Virtualmin/Webmin
      (Free) for easy to manage with GUI. If you want to host one website it is better
      to not use a panels which install non required packages and services with open
      ports and unnecessary high usage of the system resources.
