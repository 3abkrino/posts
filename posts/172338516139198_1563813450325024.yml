message: "Shabab, I have a question please in #elasticsearch \n\nIn my elasticsearch
  index, there is a field which is configured with an analyzer in the #index #mapping.
  \n\nif i tested the #analyzer with some text, it returns the expected value normally
  however when i do a #search #query applying the same analyzer on the input query,
  i can't get the expected result. if i queried by the same field text, it returns
  the content. \n\nI think i have a problem in the current indexed fields so i'm going
  to reindex the #content again but it may take time. \n\nsince i'm new in elasticsearch,
  could anyone has experience in elasticsearch advise if i need to do some more experiments
  or checks? Did i miss something?"

    message: Did you maybe update the mapping to add the analyzer after there was
      already data indexed? Also how do you test the analyzer? The _analyze API?

    message: So how are you testing it using the _analyze API? You using the analyzer
      name on the test text? Try using the field name instead, it will analyze it
      using the field's analyzer, and it will also let you know for sure if the analyzer
      is being applied to the field.

    message: I'm testing using both (the analyzer name and field name) and both are
      returning the expected tokens.

    message: If you changed anything in your index configuration (updating analyzers
      or steamers... Etc) you must reindex your data otherwise elasticsearch won't
      be able to find anything for you.
