    message: It depends, for example an application that is intended for public service
      named Yalahwy (shameless plug, sorry) we are targeting API 9 to cover as many
      devices as possible. But for another app that features OpenGL rendering we are
      targeting API 16.

    message: I guess you should be okay starting from API 4 so that you can target
      as many devices as possible, as version 4 support library includes many utilities
      and widgets that fills the gap between the older and newer SDKs.

      ignore 12.1% of the device or support them after the release of the first version
