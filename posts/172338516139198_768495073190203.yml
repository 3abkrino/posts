    message: HipChat is awesome. Biggest bonus is ability to mention someone who's
      not here and then have them receive the message via email

    message: Check assembla, bitbycket private repos, Visual Studio Online (with TFS
      for tracking work). Most often that's all you need besides email+ any form of
      chat

    message: Most often for tracking just Trello is good enough, but as mentioned
      you can get TFS tracking (best part of TFS) from VS Online. I noticed Assemblage
      free plan is not super compelling anymore.

    message: I know Trello , it is nice :D but as u said assembla is very limited
      , I guess I'm going to use slack because of its ability to integrate with many
      other tools.

    message: If you want to have a voice chat meeting I recommend "Mumble", It takes
      some time to set it up first time but is very easy to use afterwards just pick
      a free server. The voice chat is encrypted. If you want to discover other secure
      apps take a look at https://prism-break.org
