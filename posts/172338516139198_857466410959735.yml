message: "Telnet Record/Playback tool urgently needed \nI am working in a project
  where I need to do a lot of telnet and then do testing/development on the stream
  coming from the server, I was asking if there is any known software that can record
  and then playback the telnet stream so I can run the test cases when I am not able
  to connect to the specific servers, anyone aware of such a tool ?"

      I think it would be very easy to create that tool yourself as a quick console app, record mode will be a client that saves everything it recieves into a file, playback mode will be a server sending everything in that saved file :)
      Another way to achieve the same goal (the ability to test) is to abstract your code by creating an interface which has two implementations, the default one being the actual telnet client, and the other is a fake one for testing that just replies to you as if it's connected to a server :)

      during development but will fall back to needing the tool for fvt,  I will go
      for the console app , may try python if I find a suitable api
