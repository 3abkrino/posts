message: "Telnet Record/Playback tool urgently needed \nI am working in a project
  where I need to do a lot of telnet and then do testing/development on the stream
  coming from the server, I was asking if there is any known software that can record
  and then playback the telnet stream so I can run the test cases when I am not able
  to connect to the specific servers, anyone aware of such a tool ?"
