  I want to schedule tasks in my system using python.
  Shall I use Crone Jobs or a scheduler?
  Which one is better in performance?
  Or it doesn't matter?

    message: It depends on the number of jobs you want to schedule and how frequently
      are you going to maintain them. If it is one or two jobs running on a single
      machine that you are going to schedule and forget about, then just get it done
      with Cron. If it is many jobs running on multiple workers and will need frequent
      adminstration, then go with something fancier like celery.
