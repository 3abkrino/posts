  Hello, Any one here has experience with open source Identity and Access Management software?

  What I need is to authenticate users and authorize their access to certain objects. Apache Syncope provides a part of these functionalities but it doesn't provide direct authentication and authorization and needs an access manager to perform that functionality. Articles and forums recommended CAS, but apparently it needs a custom connector to integrate with Syncope which I don't want to.
