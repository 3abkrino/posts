  Guys, anybody have experience with D3? I am trying to create a dynamic Force-Directed Graph (like this: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045). It works just fine till the number of the nodes grow. I need to be able to dynamically set the radius of the nodes according to the total amount of nodes in the graph.
  Many thanks
