      I think the closest answer i have right now, is to have a list of positions and start animating to each node and when the animation end,  start animating to the next one.

    message: Ahmed Emad thanks for the help. The problem is it never goes throw the
      route it goes form a location to another even if there is a building or any
      thing it doesn't move according to the route at all.

    message: I misunderstood what you asked .. I thought that you wanted to remove
      the marker .. not move it. In addition, I'm experienced in the JS API and your
      are asking for the Android one. Thus, I removed my comment :)

      \n\nahhh! This example illustrate how you could get a driving route and from
      this point you can get the positions of each marker and then proceed with the
      first answer i gave to you. However, if you need to give the user the capability
      to navigate from X to Y while driving, i would advice you to send the longitude
      and the latitude  to start navigating to the destination ( Using the Google
      Navigation app). I hope it helps."
