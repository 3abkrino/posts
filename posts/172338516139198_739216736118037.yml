      I've always enjoyed AB for quick stuff, if I'm load testing on a production system it's non-other than Tsung. The latest thing that caught my eyes was boom in Go.
      AB is actually lovely if you know what you're doing and Tsung is an Erlang love child so that's a sweet spot for me.

      There's also Ruby's benchmark module. For a head start on AB you can follow this http://robots.thoughtbot.com/7-minute-ab-impatient-mans-load-tests-for-a-heroku it's from 2011 but still relevant.

    message: Hady Ahmed Im satisfied with ab the only thing I wish it had is results
      graphs I had to save results as a scv then visualize them with gnuplot or any
      other tool so I was wandering if there's a combo tool :D

      Yeah.. No. I came across it last year and it struck me, been serving the internet since 1999 and been stuck in 1997, so I passed.

      There's an array of tools out there, I only shared the ones I've had a pleasant experience with. Take your pick and have fun ;)

      Even at one of the world's largest corporations, we used tricks like this http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/554/how-to-monitor-cpu-memory-usage-of-a-single-process
      you start it & stop it manually, or you write a script to automate the whole process
