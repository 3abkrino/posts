message: Good Morning guys , today I've stumbled on some old articles about tech in
  arabic and tried to do some quick analysis on it, some sort text mining & Rake analysis
  and what have you since i do that for our company's blogs which is usually in Latin
  and we are costumed to some tools, not to my surprise not one tool was able to work
  on it not even the basic stuff keyword analysis , do any one have experience or
  approaches with that?
