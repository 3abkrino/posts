      i was using hybridauth but what u want need saved login info for accounts in server (you can't with javascript API) if you want to make this for exist accounts i think there is other APIs for php (Like social Hub Apps)
      if u don't need full API you can use Php_Curl But u must parse retutned Html code by hand

    message: Mahmoud Elsayed Abd Elaty authentication through oauth is just a hand
      shake technique through FB credentials for example this is through a cookie
      over your local PC using pricipal technique not access token,, saving the returned
      value is your task of course ..
