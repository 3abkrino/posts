  Is it just me or has the number of people complaining about "X software is eating my RAM" increased significantly, with the usual suspects being Chrome and Firefox?

  I mean, why do you have RAM if you do not want it used? Lately, I have been noticing people reacting with the good ol' Egyptian spirit:
  ده انا احرقها الرام دي و لا انك تستخدمها يا سوفتوير يابن اللذين.
