  If you play games, or if you hear about exciting things coming out of new rendering APIs or drool about GPU demos and what they mean;

  If you work with game & graphics engineers and hear these terms around the office;

  Or if you simply wanted to learn about rasterisation, colour blending, sub-pixel accuracy, sampling theory, supersampling, multisampling, aliasing, moire patterns, mipmaps, depth sorting, differential geometry, surface normals, shaders or what the hell GPUs do all the time

  Then this is the presentation for you. An exceptionally awesome, light & high level yet very mathematically accurate interactive introduction to that world

  by the incredibly talented Steven Wittens
