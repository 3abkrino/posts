  have one year experience with Ruby on Rails framework, really I love it other than
  any backend framework.\nI have an offer from good company to work with PHP (Drupal)/Ruby
  (Rails) (the twice) are these mix is good or not? also from career plan perspective
  is good to focus on these mixing technologies or not ? \nnote: I hate PHP"
