  have one year experience with Ruby on Rails framework, really I love it other than
  any backend framework.\nI have an offer from good company to work with PHP (Drupal)/Ruby
  (Rails) (the twice) are these mix is good or not? also from career plan perspective
  is good to focus on these mixing technologies or not ? \nnote: I hate PHP"

      Know what role you're going to take. A RoR developer or PHP developer ? If RoR then go ahead. If PHP then stay away from it if you hate PHP .. Life is too short

      But to be honest a developer should be able to work with whatever tools assigned to him... Well, I don't like this rule ! :D

    message: "Here's the best choice, being a backend engineer is the best. Never
      get stuck with one technologies (and do not get stuck with it emotionally too
      ;) ). Being a backend engineer your role is to use a mix of here and there to
      come out with the best solution. for example having a mix of node/php app or
      mongo/mysql for the same app. Being a full stack engineer will be the best ever
      ;) \nand as Rafael Adel said being a developer means that being able to work
      with whatever technology."

    message: Working on bigger products is more important to your career than the
      programming language. Even if you will use PHP only on this company, you can
      still work with RoR in your free time as a freelancer or on open-source.
