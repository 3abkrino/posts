      I did intern at orange and I can tell that, orange has a very well educational community and they focus in software engineering so you may learn many things such as testing, code review, agile, and the technology and framework trends.

      Ask both about their process and methodologies, how they manage and organize projects.
      The one that has more structure is the one you should join.
      This will probably be the larger company.
      The goal is to become a well rounded SW Engineer who can take a project from an idea to production without the chaos we produce in collage.
      Join smaller companies when you learn the structure, in smaller companies you will learn more tech and the cool toys. but you will not learn process probably.
