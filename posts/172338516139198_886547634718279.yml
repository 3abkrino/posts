  Geeks I want a good tuts or source to know more about Django and answer these questions:
  1- What goes to ModelManager and what goes to the Model?
  2- Where to put my validation? In Model or in ModelForm? and what about the REST APIs where I can place my validations?
  3- Same as 2 but for business logic?

  As recommendation and as I found: put your business logic and validation in the Model but is there any full guide or samples?
  I'm building an APIs so I won't use Django Views nor Forms and most of TDD tuts are for Views and Forms and tuts or source for that too?

  A lot of question but as you get deep into Django will find there are many ways to do things not perfect/one way to do things and this for me is confusing
