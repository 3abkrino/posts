  Geeks I want a good tuts or source to know more about Django and answer these questions:
  1- What goes to ModelManager and what goes to the Model?
  2- Where to put my validation? In Model or in ModelForm? and what about the REST APIs where I can place my validations?
  3- Same as 2 but for business logic?

  As recommendation and as I found: put your business logic and validation in the Model but is there any full guide or samples?
  I'm building an APIs so I won't use Django Views nor Forms and most of TDD tuts are for Views and Forms and tuts or source for that too?

  A lot of question but as you get deep into Django will find there are many ways to do things not perfect/one way to do things and this for me is confusing

      I didn't complete the "Two Scoops of Django", but the answer might be there. Here are my recommendations

      1- ModelManager is the DB abstraction layer. It's similar to the repository pattern which is popular in .net. As an example, if you want to implement soft-delete (where objects are not actually deleted, but a flag is set), you can do something like

      Employees.objects.active()

      `active` is a method on the model manager, which filters against the deleted flag. You can implement more methods in your manager to give a better API, e.g.

      Route.objects.within_distance(station1, Distance(miles=1))

      2- ModelForm is like the ViewModel pattern. There will be more than 1 ModelForm per model. Personally I prefer to put all of my validation in the model, but there are cases where the validation should be in the ModelForm itself. BTW you can use ModelForm with APIs as well, but you should use django-rest-framework instead

      3- Business logic should be in the model itself. I believe in "thin controller, fat model"
