      I drink Davidoff instant coffee, I get the "rich aroma" because I prefer taste over sa7sa7a, but there is also another variant that is more about the sa7sa7a :D
      When it comes to cafes, Espresso Lab (Point 90 tagamo3) has the best coffee when it comes to waking up and focusing, and if you really want to ruin any chance of sleeping, get their cold-brew coffee (it's in a bottle so you can take it home) and drink it as-is without any sugar or anything :D

    message: I drink tea..  Also by the time it lost its effect gradually.. Or at
      least that's what I feel..  The same goes to coffee too.. You're searching for
      a stronger effect because you're used to the old one and you'll keep on doing
      that until you really stop
