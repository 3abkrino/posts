message: I am working on a javascript intensive project that I wanted to wrap in a
  webview to "app"itize it but I was disappointed by the poorly performing android
  WebView ,  Crosswalk is a web runtime built around Chromium which gave me the performance
  I needed for my app. I am still discovering it but I thought I'd share it with you
  guys.
