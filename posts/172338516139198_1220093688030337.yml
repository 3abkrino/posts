  Hello
  Have anyone here tried to build a messenger chatbot using JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework)?
  How was your experience?
  and if not what do you think about it?
  We want to build the bot from scratch WITHOUT using top-layer tools such as api.ai or wit.ai

      are convenient with / business needs.
