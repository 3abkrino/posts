message: "I have a problem i want to solve and i wonder if anyone can here help me
  with it. \nI am trying to run two shell scripts on two different threads in python.
  The first one is a decoder that produces its output into a directory , if the number
  of the output files in that directory exceeded X files i wait, the other thread
  is another decoder that reads the file and use it as input, when its done decoding
  it eliminates the file. \n\nThis problem is similar to the producer consumer problem,
  i firstly implemented its code and then modified the condition to work on the problem
  by sharing the Num_of_folders as the global variable instead of qeue, \n\ni.e: The
  first decoder is now the producer which writes until X num of files, the second
  one is consumer which reads the files decode and then remove it. \n\nThe problem
  that the producer thread always write files even if the condition.wait() is applied
  that means both threads are not working synchronously. \n\nCan anyone help me with
  this porblem or can provide another solution instead of consumer/producer algorithm?"
