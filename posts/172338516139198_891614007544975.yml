  Dear Linux geeks, does anyone know what it would take for me to take over a linux distribution that will be discontinued?

  Please help, it is my favourite distribution and I am literally in tears over this. I have not been this sad since someone died, in fact someone died and I was not this sad at all.

  Please help.
