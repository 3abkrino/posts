  Turning EMACS into a Python IDE, you will never know the pleasure of coding until you do it on EMACS with auto complete :)

  P.S. it took me ages to find this, I spent a week trying to do it 2 months ago but I gave up, then this made it very easy and I got to enjoy it finally, I couldn't sleep out of pure happiness. I am still looking for a way to set up a short cut to run the code in the buffer, would appreciate some Geeky input here
