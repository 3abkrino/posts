message: "How do u deal with a perfectionist client? \n\nSomeone who wants to overwrite
  everything's standard, and question everything to be customized.\n\nfor example
  why the navbar collapse with smaller sizes ? Why we can't get the small size menu
  without collapsing ? Things like that which would make the people who came up with
  responsive design wish if they didn't and suicide.\n\nThat's an example for what
  i go through, things like standards for example how col-md-4 align in smaller size
  he wants every single thing in bootstrap to be overwritten to achieve what he wants.
  Am i wrong or this is a crazy thing. Because what i know that those frameworks are
  made to give us easy and fast and good maintainable code !!!"

    message: In such cases, don't use bootstrap! Writing everything you need from
      scratch is going to be much faster than overriding everything in whatever framework
      you are using.

    message: Did you make him sign a contract, or at least give you the OK online?
      Did your agreement include spec document & UI prototype? Did you specify that
      change requests cost money?
