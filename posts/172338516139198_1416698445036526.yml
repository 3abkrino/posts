  I'm trying to setup FTP server on a Fedora machine behind a NAT, Host Win10 Virtualbox, Guest Fedora Server.

  I have tried both active and passive setups, but I always stuck at "illegal port command".

  Some websites mentioned that setting up a FTP server on Vbox guest machine is always buggy.

  Any help?
