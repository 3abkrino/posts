    message: although it has some new cool features but its not recommended as it
      is still in beta not very stable and very slow .. about tutorials to lean about
      it if u know about eclipse for android this will be enough.

    message: Android studio is dedicatedly developed for android development so alot
      of features are configured for you but eclipse is a blank ide you have to configure
      everything by yourself okay  android studio is beta now but I guess it would
      be the future for android applications
