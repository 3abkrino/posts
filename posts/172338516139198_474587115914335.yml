  When I see the tour video in this product homepage, I feel that the .NET world is so fragmented. See how things like BDD-tests, feature-branches, DB-migrations, environment-configuration (dev, prod, ..), and more ... are just seemly integrated together.
  It's not just a tool thing I believe, sure, the IDE makes it much easier, but the defined (obviously opinionated) process is there, and looks pretty mature. I'm officially impressed.
