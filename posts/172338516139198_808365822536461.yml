message: Guys, I'm overwhelmed by choice available on the interwebz. I need a simple
  wordpress popup plugin that allows me to write custom HTML content for the pop up
  and set a delay time (to allow visitors to read the page before showing the pop
  up). Anyone has some personal favourites for this?
