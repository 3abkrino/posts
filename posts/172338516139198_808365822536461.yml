message: Guys, I'm overwhelmed by choice available on the interwebz. I need a simple
  wordpress popup plugin that allows me to write custom HTML content for the pop up
  and set a delay time (to allow visitors to read the page before showing the pop
  up). Anyone has some personal favourites for this?

      the topic for me, but I''d appreciate personal picks more than promising google
      results, as I have been trying several of those now and got tired of random
      tries. Also, if you think the entire pop up thing is bad, then I have a lot
      of explanation to do, but that''s not the topic of the question. Just move on.'
