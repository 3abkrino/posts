message: "SA, I'm currently developing an API Wrapper as a ruby gem for a video streaming
  rest API called Wowza and I'm trying to adopt a TDD/BDD approach of doing things,
  I'm using RSpec, VCR and Webmock for unit testing, so I wanna know if there are
  any famous or important techniques/tools used in designing/developing/testing API
  wrappers? especially in ruby or in general\n\nWhat i have so far :\n- I've read
  Designing a beautiful api ch2, and I'm planning to read Test Driven Development:
  By Example for kent beck that some people recommended to read on quora and reddit\n-
  went through a couple of articles about TDD, and api wrappers \n- I'm currently
  watching this playlist about TDD https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPHP6RGS50NtpHLee-eInDbFqy3P303g
  that someone here recommended to watch\n- went through the source code of twitter
