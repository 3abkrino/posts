      Answering Q1: Logging allows you to write information to trace the execution of your program. You can write this information to a file, DB, message queue, logging server, etc.

      A logging framework will do many things for you, like rolling files, handling multiple threads writing to log, log to multiple targets at the same time).

      Writing a file has many different purposes. You can write a configuration file, output results file, html file, etc.Writing a log file is one of these purposes.

      A lot of people do logging by writing to a file directly. Do this only for very simple things.

      You should learn the logging framework for your programming language. It will help you know the difference.

      I will leave the answer to Q2 to other people here :)
