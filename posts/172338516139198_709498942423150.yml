  Some Fun ...

  Team Succeeds by Increasing Bug Quality

  “Our users have amazing fun searching for workarounds to our bugs, so we had to carefully design, implement and test each bug to increase their experience. As a result, we had multiple reports from our users saying that "I stopped playing Angry Birds and started looking for workarounds in your application instead. I just couldn't get enough of it!".

  “We introduced the roles of bug owner, bug user experience designer and bug architect in the team. Developers started test driving the bugs because it makes much more sense than test driving bug-free code. Finally, we are measuring the business value of each bug in terms of customer feedback and prioritize the bugs based on the experience we think they create.”
