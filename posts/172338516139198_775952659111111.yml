  Are there any java developers who wrote applications that deals with SQL Server database ?

  is it normal that update operations take too much time ? Are there any suggestion , tips , recommended way to connect java code to sql server to do some insertion and update operations. Thanks in advance.

      Whether it is in the SQL Server stack or the Java stack or network?

    message: Use SQL Profiler from Tools menu in management studio or from start menu.
      Start a session and try the scenario that takes long time. This will give you
      an idea if the problem in the sql server stack.

    message: SQL server itself is working fine. The problem appears when I try to
      connect java with sql server in Netbeans. The update operation takes too much
      time

    message: You can't improve what you can't measure, you need to profile first to
      see how much time is being spent for executing the update statement, and then
      do a change for example add an index or modify the statement and profile again
      and see if that really helped

    message: SQL profiler as Adel K. Khalil said is the way to go, but this will only
      measure SQL server time, if the problem is somewhere else you will need another
      tool for that.
