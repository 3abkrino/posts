  I need to get all streets name in Cairo or Tahrir

  i tried to draw a shape by Polygon in googleApi and then get all streets under this shape all latLng(s) in this zone.

  but google api just provide any thing in response except streets(routes)

  Note: i used openstreetmap.org but there are many locations and streets have no names.

  Feel free for suggestion or share your experience.

    message: Street names is a big issue in Egypt since they are not number based
      Google have a Api called geocoding it transfers real time address like 5 Adam
      strret to x,y ....but they have a reverse method to get the addresses via x,y
      give it a shot

    message: what you need to do is to get a vertex out of each route that was returned
      to you and send it in the latlng parameter in the reverse geocoding http request
      via Google's Geocoding API
