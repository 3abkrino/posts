message: "I used to use gitk as an essential tool with git \nI was very productive
  and comfortable with it.\n\nnow I had to work on mac machine \nafter making the
  configurations necessary to have gitk in my bash.\n \nI had a weird problem that
  after opening it by 30 second it hangs and consume 100% of cpu \nthen it returns
  to normal state and then hangs and so on.\n\nIf you can help me please as I didn't
  find any other tool that can really replace it for me \nI tried gitx and other tools
  but it's never like gitk \"in my opinion\""

      Is it repo specific? Have you tried it with different repos?

      Try to run git GC on your repo.
