  Hi guys, I am following hacker news (news.ycombinator.com) recently and noticed that every two days a new programming language appear nearly without any new feature, I think the last well designed language was Scala since then nothing new, What about you do you think about any good PL that appear in the last ten years and have something to mention
  Thank you
