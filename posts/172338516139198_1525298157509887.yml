    message: I used Google Assistant and Siri, Siri is completly useless. but GA is
      promising, I find it handy when setting up alarms, playing a particular song
      when I am using my headphones and the phone is in my pocket,  also the simple
      commands of "Navigate to home", "Uber to home", "Morning brief", etc are kinda
      cool. all these voice commands are handy and Siri or Alexa are pretty good with
      those too, but what is useful about GA is the google now app, and the now cards.
      I find them very useful, The card of unusual traffic on the morning or when
      I am about to leave to home, the tracking card for items I bought online,  the
      suggested photo albums and animations from google photos, the suggested calendar
      event when I receive an email with a date. Cards are neat and helpful, and google
      keeps on improving them.
