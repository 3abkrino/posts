  It's 4 in the morning and it's time for a rails question :

  If I have a Model user that have many posts and a post belongs to one user "many to one"

  How can I get to do another relation in active record to handle the user likes many posts ? "Many to Many"

      You can add another has_and_belongs_to_many association independent from the existing one...  You can actually do as many associations as you want between the 2 models

      The default convention will be one..  But you are not limited to that

      In the "likes"  this is not necessarily HABTM

      It could be user has many likes and posts has many likes (if u want to recording the timing of the action for example)
