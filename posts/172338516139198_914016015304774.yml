  Hey there,
  I'm a 17-year-old Egyptian. I'll finish high school in 4 months.
  I love all kinds of technology.
  I've already started learning Front-End Web Development online..Finished HTML/CSS courses and about to finish a Javascript course..
  I've little experience with Graphic Design (Mainly Photoshop) and I know I'll have to get better at it to be a better Web Designer.
  But I can't really decide which field to choose as my main skill or career.
  The main fields I have in mind are: Web Development (Full-stack), Graphic Design (Logos, Branding, and things like that), Android Development, and Motion Graphics (2D).
  So..What the hell should I do? :D
  Thank you!
