    message: I have a single instance of mysql db on Ubuntu up and running and its
      serving the purpose. I really dont wana shoot a flie with a canon and add up
      too much complexity just cause once in 3 years db crashed in middle of rush
      hour and i had to manually reboot it :D!! Although our poor customer support
      had couple angry phone calls after and it toom me 16mins to plug in laptop find
      wifii and reboot the thing! But this incidence had me thinking small projects
      still need some backup plans! Right?
