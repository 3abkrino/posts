      Your problem has 2 sides:
      1- storage/memory => 4k objects * (say) 1k = around 4 MB, which is not that big in web *application*
      --> keeping the objects in memory is the *fastest* way!
      if you still have problems in memory, you can use sqlite + sql.js
      2- searching in objects => you can use any standard search algorithm, or use sql queries in case you will use sqlite
