  The design review from hell:

  The TA does a design review on a small application that does surveys and saves them to the database.

  TA: I was looking at your database design, You have a list of questions for each survey. The wierd thing is that you have each question as a column in your table and each survey as a separate table.

  TL: That is correct.

  TA: But that means to add another question to a survey, you need to add another column to the table and to add another Survey you need to add another table.

  TL: That is correct.

  TA: But shouldn't we be doing basic database normalization and actually be able to add a question as a row? Shouldn't surveys have their own table with each survey having it's own row? Wouldn't that make adding an extra question or survey very easy and simple.

  TL: The customer only asked for 5 surveys.

  TA: And what happens when he wants to add a question to a survey or a new survey?

  TL: He will create a change request and we will do it for him.

  TA: Yeah, but if you had tables and rows like I said you would just have to add some rows in each table.

  TL: The time it wil take me to add a row, is the time it will take me to add a new table with columnns as questions.

  TA: But you can just build a page so the customer can create his own surveys and add questions to them.

  TL: That is not in our scope or in the requirements, we will be the ones adding the questions.

  TA: Are you kidding me? Why am I wasting my time like this? I'm not here to explain basic database design. Why do you even ask for a design review?

  TL: Because the process says so. If you want to complain, talk to the PM.

  TA: PM, this is basics of computer science here, what are we arguing about?

  PM: I don't have time for design, and I don't have time to do the right thing
