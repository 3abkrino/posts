  I wanted to wipe the HDD in my laptop as I am selling it, and was researching solutions online when I came upon this "built in" solution for Windows.

  Windows 7 (and 8) has a cipher.exe that is used for drive encryption but can also be used for wiping. Just execute:

  cipher /W:<dir>

  Where <dir> is your drive/directory you need to wipe. What it will do is write zeros on that location, and then write ones, and finally write random values.

  Just thought of sharing. And btw, Linux geeks, no mocking :D
