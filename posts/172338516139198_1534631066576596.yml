  i have a login form that sends username and password to a Java backend which sends back an authentication token
  problem is that the network debugging tab showing the credentials that have been entered  in the request payload.
  the form is a part of angular 2+ app.
  any suggestions for what am i doing wrong or suggestions for search keywords ?

  i found this on my search
  https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/171418/why-make-the-login-page-to-a-single-page-application-a-separate-page

  but still can't figure out if there is a way to secure a SPA or i have to server side rendering

      Calm down, dude
      That's normal, you can see the credentials, because that's still within the browser context, what you should be worried about, is nobody else can see them when s/he intercepts the request, which is covered by https

    message: "You should not worry about the username & Password in your browser,
      only after you submit the form and the data travels from your PC to the server.\nYou
      can only worry if your computer is hacked and the hacker has access to your
      browser and can detect what you are typing and in this case you have much concerns
      to worry about :)\n\nIf you want to make it harder. You can simply encrypt the
      username and password from JavaScript code using a public key and send it encrypted,
      in the server you will decrypt it using the private key. \n\nIn this case no
      one will know your password unless he has a key logger"
