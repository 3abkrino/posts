  I'm trying to build a model that predict revenue for single click that comes via online-marketing channels such as Google, Amazon shopping.

  The dataset consists of historical clicks with the Sum(revenue) came from these clicks in addition to the number of clicks but the problem with the dataset is revenue equals zero for more that 99% of clicks. So when I use Regression it is skewed towards zero and When I tried to over sample the non-zero values, it gives a big mean absolute error relative to the mean of the revenue. Any suggestions please ?
