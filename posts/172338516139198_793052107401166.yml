    message: I have not tried it myself, but my company as a whole is heavily investing
      in it with many clients and seeing tremendous success. The guys in Xamarin are
      so smart and doing their job very well, with inside support from equally smart
      people at Microsoft, so, the result product really reflects that.

    message: it`s awesome i tried the student licence , it`s simply works to compile
      your c# code to the java or objective c  code , the result is run a real native
      app . but it`s dependent on your architecture of app if you need a huge application
      i recommend xamarin but a note (the apk will be huge with xamarin ), if  u need
      a small app use (phoneGap or intel XDK ) but it`s run on HTML viewer , finally
      you should try the new android studio it`s really very good i amazed

    message: Actually I was about to ask this question .. I have a server/client mobile
      app all data coming from the server .. Is Xamarin that good  when it comes to
      performance .. I had a very bad experience with phoneGap since when I hate cross-browser
      approaches?!

      I haven't played a lot with it, but I made a small game with MonoGame framework (XNA port) and I used Xamarin Trial and it worked great.
      @Marwan Atef: It compiles C# to IL (like the Microsoft's compiler) then for iOS then do some Ahead-of-Time compilation to iOS Native, and for Android they package Mono's runtime (interpreter) with your app's IL (that's why the APK is huge).
      The Xamarin guys claim that C# runs faster than Java on Android in many cases, and they actually tried porting some parts of Android from Java to C# and it worked faster :D

      so xamarin is like writing the same code and compile it for different platforms?
      one code => 2 native apps?
