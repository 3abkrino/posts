    message: Every candidate/position/experience/company combination will yield a
      different interview -> offer path. I wouldn't put much emphasis on how many
      tries it took others to get there.

    message: I see what you mean of course. It's just that I know that some people
      start to give up after a couple tries and think it's beyond them, I thought
      getting a sort of average would help put things in perspective.

      I sent around 90+ resumes, just to get a single interview! And got an offer from that single company as lead engineer and i wasn't even aiming for that!! Most of jobs i applied for and got rejected just by look of my resume was for junior lvl.

      Better have more interviews and learn from the feedback then land a better job with higher salary now that you can better present yourself and answer common questions, than just getting accepted by the first company you interview.

      I turned down the first offer I got, because I knew I was not that good and the technology was old but mainly because I knew I can land a better job still.

      If you see you get rejected many times right after you apply, then take a break and review your resume.
      Otherwise, review what you did/said in this specific step during the interview

      And if you see yourself failing in too many companies, take a step back for let say couple of months, stop doing interviews (علشان ما تحرقش نفسك في شركات كتير، لأن كل شركة ما ينفعش تقدم فيها تاني غير بعد مدة
      ٦ شهور او سنة او يمكن اكتر)

    message: I live in Europe since many years, the main problem of rejection is visa
      sponsorship... The whole process is like that, they contact the work force organization
      IF there is a German guy that fits for the job, If there is no one, they look
      IF there is a European who is registered and looking for a job, IF there is
      no other European, They can sponsor you for a visa.. as you see its a complicated
      process... IF you fit a lot of these obstacles, you need to earn more than 45k
      euro per year.
