  Guys,

  What's the best self hosted script to run email marketing campaigns, we all know MailChimp, CampaignMonitor .etc which gets freaking expensive if you have a lot of subscribers, we used this simple script http://codecanyon.net/item/newsletter-system/52667 but it was very very elementary with few tracking options.

  I'm looking for a self-hosted email newsletter system with a bit more advanced options that preferably can work with Wordpress.

  This seems like a hot option:

  What do you think?
