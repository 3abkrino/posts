  I'm currently using Mocha to test node js app, the thing is the only strategy allowed in my app to login is Facebook Strategy, so as long as you have facebook account you can sign up/in, but the question is:
  Is it possible to write a test for a route that needs the user to be authenticated? if yes, how could I get this user?
