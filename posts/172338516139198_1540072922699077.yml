      it is not a good idea.. it is there for a reason

      you could tey finding a better cooling mechanism, changing fans or figure out something

      or maybe there is an issue with toggling the fan, i had this issue when i dual booted a macbook once with linux in that case u could find some bash scripts online to handle this; increasing fan speed depending on the temperature sensor (sorry i forgot where i found this, google a little and ull find the script)
