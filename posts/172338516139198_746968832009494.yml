  I'm thinking of using my blog for all my posts online (like a tumblr). I'm searching for a theme with these features

  1. Clean UI
  2. Good support for Arabic (or easy to do myself)
  3. Beautiful !!!
  4. As tumblr, some posts will have no title, just a post date & some text

  Any suggestions?
