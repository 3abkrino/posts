  Is there any Chrome/FireFox extension, app or anything else can download photos album from facebook page?

    message: I once had a Firefox extension that could bulk-download all images on
      a certain page, it even allowed you to highlight a rectangular area and it would
      fetch all images inside it, but I can't remember its name :\
