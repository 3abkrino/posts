message: "SA\nI am looking for recommendation to learn development under linux professionally
  in c++ (basically to develop machine learning libraries as its my specialization)\nwith
  the help of a friend i have started getting familiar with Qt editor and basic testing
  libraries (catch library)\nWhat i need is a good source to learn about makefiles
  and configuration files. \n\nalso my experience is research related so my development
  skills are not superior, i need a good source in OOP with c++ (preferably a course
  not a book)\n\nThanks"

      Read about the standard library here http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header

      You can take a look at Caffe deep learning framework here http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org

      if you want to get into machine learning, deep neural networks and stuff like that you may need to learn about CUDA or OPENCL as well. You can find lectures and courses on youtube teaching these two.

      You also can head to nvidia and take some online labs
      here https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/education/
