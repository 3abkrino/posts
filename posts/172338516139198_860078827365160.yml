  Guys, I have a question just for interest for the UI Designers and the UI Developers, How long approximately does it take you normally to get the first landing page designed/coded starting from being assigned on the task till you get it done?

  I know that it depends on many factors, but I've been wondering for sometime how would my workflow be faster/slower than the others.

  In another words, how can you know if it takes you longer or shorter than it supposed to take?
