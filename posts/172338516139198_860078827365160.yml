  Guys, I have a question just for interest for the UI Designers and the UI Developers, How long approximately does it take you normally to get the first landing page designed/coded starting from being assigned on the task till you get it done?

  I know that it depends on many factors, but I've been wondering for sometime how would my workflow be faster/slower than the others.

  In another words, how can you know if it takes you longer or shorter than it supposed to take?

      It takes me about 3~4 days to make all templates initially (Usually the master/root template, homepage, 1 column and 2 columns templates) then after all website development is completed I spend about 1~1.5 day adjusting responsive stuff , testing, optimization, cleaning, styling new elements/components/widgets/templates that we added during the development .. etc.

      Back to the days before modern browsers and before Bootstrap and similar frameworks, having to support IE, a lot of hacking and browsers incompatibilities, a lot of testing-fixing-F5 cycles on multiple browsers simultaneously it was taking more 5~6 days or so.

      But you know it depends, sometimes a homepage might take 4 days if it has some special UI widgets, animations or new requirements or eftekasat.. etc.

      The more clear requirements you get and the more wire-frames/design/concept you get that covers all cases and answers all the questions that popup in your mind during the implementation the more it becomes a piece of cake and takes less time and efforts even if the design is sophisticated.

      I mean the templates/master-pages plus the homepage. For other sub pages.. the majority usually contain simple links, images, paragraphs.. etc, a few of them contain stuff like galleries, grids, tabs.. etc but styling them does not take a long time because they will inherit a lot of styles. You know by completing the homepage and the main templates you complete the styles for links, headers, different types of buttons, sliders, icons.. lists, containers, bread-crumbs and maybe forms too and so on which makes other pages almost get automatically styled.

      Am I slow or fast? I don't care because I believe that if I am slow and want to become faster I can easily do that by learning and practicing, I consider myself fast enough as long as I deliver the project on time and the client/boss is happy with the results.

      If it is your boss who thinks you or your team is slow consider reading this:

      Yehya Hafez : about 15 : 18 hours

      but this is a template for usage not for sale ,

      to be for sale you need to duplicate the hours , so that you get the CSS optimized and the code as well
