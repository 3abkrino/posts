  I have a question, Is it best to mention your freelance work in your cv and consequently in an interview or you are better of without mentioning that ?
  For I've met different interviewers and/or managers who reacted differently to that. so what do you think ?

    message: "Mohamed Alaa,Mohammad Tayseer, The problem is not where to put i'm talking
      about the concept itself as some managers will consider your freelance project
      a great thing as it mean you work more, you gain experience and you are active
      outside the work environment. on the other side some managers \"sadly\" will
      use this against you if you can't stay late they will say because you work at
      home, if you can't come in weekends they will say that too. they might even
      think that if you reading any blog about any technology that you need it for
      your freelance work :) \n I've met both of these types :) but I wanna know which
      one exist more :)"
