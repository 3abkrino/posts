    message: هو الاهم من انه يبدا بايه ايه وجه الاستفادة من البرمجة لما يتعلمها خصوصا
      في السن ده هل لشغل معين ؟؟ فاللغة الي يختارها تكون على الاساس ده يعني لو ويب
      يبدا بال html/css عادي بعد كده يبدا في java script ، وعن نفسي شايف انه يتعلم
      python ويبعد عن ال structured language زي ال c ، المهم يختار المجال الي عايز
      يمشي فيه وبعد كده يحدد اللغة الي هيستخدمها

      First, sorry I don't have an Arabic keyboard atm. second, I am exactly in the situation you're describing. I've been trying to shift career from electrical engineering to something tech since 2013/14, and it is not working out for me because I never had a plan of what I wanted to do. I learned the web stack, then got into Ruby and Rails because I needed to build something full-stack with API's and all... but then Ruby became a rabbit hole where I was just opening courses and books after one another and still didn't get the hang of it on a professional level. Especially that it puts so much emphasis on test-driven-development and meta-programming, and its OOP is on steroids. I haven't done anything with it beyond that, and I feel I've already forgotten it.

      I recently started again with Python, this time with a plan. I want to work on hardware like embedded systems, and machine learning related projects, and Python is flexible enough to give me that. So I'd advise you with it, plus few things related to HTTP/REST and JSON and basic stuff like that. Now I learned the latter with Ruby-Rails, so I don't know of standalone courses.

      As for Python, you HAVE TO start with "Learn Python the Hard Way", then follow it up with with courses from Udemy. I found those much more handson than Coursera. They often have discounts so you can buy courses for 10 dollars each. Just stick with the ones designed for beginners and have many reviews. There are some by Ardit Sulce, but I found his accent a bit distracting towards the end of the course. Jose Portilla is a great instructor on Udemy. There is also Sentdex free on YouTube. In another note, I do miss Ruby when I am trying out Python, it was just a real joy to work with, but again, not the best first language.

      Hello, I don't have Arabic KB as well, sorry.
      My advice to you would be a little bit different if you don't have solid reasons to be a programmer and only programmer, I would say go for the QA (Quality Assurance/SW Testing). Briefly, 1- You don't need the foundation to be a programmer. 2- Easy to be on track with online courses and even offline certificate from Cairo/gov (can search for u if you are interested). 3- Very short track. 4- Options are available to find a job in Cairo or abroad(Germany for ex.)
