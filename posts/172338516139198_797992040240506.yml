    message: twitter search api doesn't get you tweets back for this long period.
      the twitter index only holds tweets from around 6-9 days ago (and not all the
      tweets for this period either). the only way to get historical twitter data
      is through another service that is a partner with twitter that provides historical
      twitter data access like http://gnip.com/

      know it. because i used to have the same problem. :)

      Well you sound reasonable :)), I searched for it for 2 days.
      the way i came out with is to use the web advanced search and render it with phantomjs, and let the spider go twitter =D

    message: interestingly, i noticed that the twitter search through the website
      returns more tweets and for periods of time more than the search api index.
      but it's still a very small subset of the total number of tweets that is already
      there (couple hundreds when the actual number may be thousands or tens of thousands)

    message: I was thinking about doing something else with Twitter and went PhantomJS
      as well (was playing, never made it to production, yet), good I wasn't completely
      insane as someone else thought in a similar way. Although I didn't really use
      PhantomJS directly (used Selenium to talk to it, and when debugging ran it in
      Chrome instead of PhantomJS to see and debug easily).
