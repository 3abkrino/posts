  Very important Notice,

  Please guys give more attention to our group policy and your target audience. We are not html5 beginners and we don't want to know how to clean our RAM. Think twice before you share something and before you add your post in your group and ask your self. is this something that will really make people open their mouth when they see it? if the answer is yes then go a head and show us your power.

  We look for Quality and not Quantity. we don't want to end up as any random group for sharing links as this is not our target.

  We are here to share our knowledge with you, give you the best answers to your questions and to keep our community a luxury community for the top Geeks in Egypt.

  Thanks to all of you who keep up with our policies.
  Mohamed
