  CSharp - i have to deal with a very large number to loop through and check the number IsSquare or not and count them. BTW The code is works fine with 32bit int range , but when i tried long,Int64,BigInteger the app is hang at runtime with no exception and i checked the task manager it consumes more than 30% of CPU and 5MB of RAM and takes a lot of time without any output while running also i have debugged the loop to check the values and it also hangs on large numbers .

  any suggestions would be appreciated :)
