  Help please
  Did you use before Ui-Route inside AngularJs Modal window?
  I have an angular modal window that acts like wizard form of multi steps but when using state routing it doesn't seem it works fine with me!!

      Yes but my case is Open modal at first step is to upload file and after that file uploaded successfully then at its success handler i should navigate to another view.
      Currently first step works successfully but when i hit success handler and call $state.go('sellerAction') it doesn't navigate to that state

    message: Well, file upload is always a hassle in these JS apps. Have you tried
      a fiddle without the upload? What are you using for upload?

    message: Hmm. I have only used https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload with
      AngularJS in the past, but have you been able to reproduce this without the
      upload functionality?
