message: "Hi guys, \n\nThe GM asked me to find a way for a rapid development cross
  platform system.. He wants to increase the productivity but I have concerns regarding
  the ready made tools rather I want a tool that can generate cross platform code
  but give me the ability to customize the code and add an architectural touch on
  it. \n\nCould you help please?"

    message: There are no silver bullets. Even the choice to go crossplatform vs native
      depends on what you are doing and how you want to achieve it. Generic requests
      like "increased productivity" are usually a sign of bad things to come. What
      exactly is your GM trying to achieve?
