  The recording is from Brisbane but they had the same session in Sydney first and it was one of the best offline sessions I have attended ever.

  Will get you introduced to Functional Programming in C#, Higher Order Functions, Monads, and much more.

  BTW, if you don't know already, Joe Albahari is the creator of Linqpad.
