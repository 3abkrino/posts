    message: hmm.. the beginning point might be `git reflog`, then going by what you
      see in there. reflog is very strong utility

    message: Already used it but it didn't help. to be more clear an Orphan branch
      doesn't have a parent that's the problem. you create a new branch with no history
      so I "guess" that's why reflog is not working

      Yes, because an orphan branch has no parent commit so when you delete it apparently you delete all of it's history too & since it's doesn't point to any commits in the history of any branch you can't get it back.
