message: Does anyone know of a decent CAD library that features drawing plus reading
  and writing DXF or DWG files? Having its custom viewports with pan/zoom would be
  great but not necessary.

      I think DWG is a closed format, so you'll probably have to reverse-engineer the file format, or check if someone already did that, but even then it might not be legal though.
      If you could export the files as FBX though then you can easily read it and render it, I think all Autodesk products can export/import FBX, and they made a tool called FBX Converter than can convert 3DS, DXF, DAE and OBJ to FBX.

    message: Open Asset Import Library (assimp) seems to support DXF but I didn't
      test it with that format, so it should allow you to parse DXF files, there is
      also a .Net wrapper for it :)
