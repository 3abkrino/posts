    message: I have recently implemented an SMPP client for my cloud services. Here
      is what you need. You need an SMS provider someone who can send SMS and receive
      SMS so you need to contact a local telecom company. Most likely you would have
      to setup a vpn connection with their network and sign a contract for prices
      and then they would allow you to use their SMPP server. You as a client would
      then make a connection that would allow you to send SMS and receive SMS to your
      number over the SMPP protocol (you normally choose a shortcode that appears
      as the sender to your SMS recipients). There are many libraries for that depending
      on your programming language, I just implemented my client using one for node
      js.

      I see two options here without contacting a local telecom company
      1. Simple - Twilio API is very easy to use ( Using webhooks it can deliver messages to your server by HTTP POST requests )
      2. Complicated - Requires embedded system knowledge,  Use a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino with a GSM module to send and receive SMS . The raspberry can forward then the request via the internet to your server
