  How about an application that has 18K classes of which 3K are interfaces? There is even a header file with the name FBEventUpdateNotificationSubscriptionLevelMutationOptimisticPayloadFactoryProtocol-Protocol.h, talk about self documenting code.

  I know working at Facebook sounds really cool, but I would not want to be the one going through that sort of a project to fix a bug.
