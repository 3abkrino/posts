message: "Hi Geeks, i want to ask u about something but i don't know if it is violates
  the posting roles; if it is , feel free to remove it ;)\n\nI was asked to develop
  an app for a clinic, obviously this is supposed to be a small project. I am a web
  developer but due to the project size i considered Java Swing, as it is easy to
  install and doesn't require an application server to run it. \n\ndue to your experience,
  is this a good decision. java swing with old JDBC is fine with small apps ?"

    message: why not? If you can be productive with it quickly, then it is a good
      choice. Old JDBC or ODBC is fine as you just need to connect to the database
      and do your usual CRUD operations.

    message: because i would need another apps to make it running. like a web server
      . I am just aiming for simplicity and speed development. I am afraid that the
      client will feel strange to use IE or FireFox

    message: why not as M.Samy said ... even if it's not the best way to develop on
      windows ... always consider the time constraints ... for sure, you will take
      a lot of time to learn something new ... this learning curve time will be added
      to the total project time... Thus if you are learning something complex you
      will take a lot of time which will make the project revenue like nothing for
      you.. the more simple, fast the better it is for business apps if you are seeking
      revenue ... otherwise, if you are seeking to get some knowledge and invest in
      yourself ... I think using the WPF framework would be a very good fancy choice
      for doing such a windows application like this 1.... best wishes;

      Well, it is all up to you .. What I suggest is (it might be wrong):
      since you are a web developer, you can use different web technologies to accomplish the assigned project .. afterwards you can either submit a documentation for the people who are going to use that app for the clients so that they get to know how to use it or you simply educate them of how to use the app.

      Web server might be a problem if you are working with web technologies .. Okay, forget about my suggestion for now and go for the most productive way you are familiar with

      (I should be in bed by now) =D

      I used Nullsoft installer to create a setup file that gives the client this "offline application feel". The installer installs the HTTP server, the database server and configures everything and then adds a shortcut to the application on the user desktop. Unless the user is very perceptive and tech-savvy, he may not notice he is running a web app

      Mohamed Alaa El Din that's off topic from what the OP was asking for. The OP is talking swing, so it's clearly a desktop application, Sinatra won't build you a desktop app.

      One possible option, is to build a desktop application using web technologies, the sdk I tried for this was http://www.tidesdk.org/
