message: "Hi Geeks, i want to ask u about something but i don't know if it is violates
  the posting roles; if it is , feel free to remove it ;)\n\nI was asked to develop
  an app for a clinic, obviously this is supposed to be a small project. I am a web
  developer but due to the project size i considered Java Swing, as it is easy to
  install and doesn't require an application server to run it. \n\ndue to your experience,
  is this a good decision. java swing with old JDBC is fine with small apps ?"
