      of monetary systems, it just had a rocky start. Stil some regulation that needs
      to be done but it certainly caught on fast due to the huge advantages, with
      now over 400 cryptocurrencies with over \"$ 8,754,044,522\" in market capital.

      I've been following up on this whole cryptocurrency world since last December, I'm pretty impressed by the technology too, it's not just normal P2P sharing (like BitTorrent), it's a system that gets more secure with more users and you need to control more that 50% of the computing power in order to mess with it.
      and I like the idea of having controlled inflation that exponentially decreases until there is zero inflation, some people say that deflationary currency will not be used as currency (because it will always be better to hold and not spend), but it's a very interesting experiment nonetheless :)

    message: I'm also very interested in how easy it is to integrate international
      micro-transactions into apps and games, no more messing with paypal and smartphone
      stores, no middlemen :)
