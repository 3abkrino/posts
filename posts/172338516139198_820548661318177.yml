  It's maybe considered a silly question, but I'm really dizzy about it..
  how it works? I mean the access token.
  i.e WordPress authentication goes this way:
  $credentials = array(
    'username': 'boo',
    'password': 'foo',
  );
  wp_signon($credentials, false);
  It's the concept of user and password.. so I only use the api to retriever the email address then sign him/her using only email address..
  is it nasty this way?? if so, how should it be then??
  I appreciate any help thanks.
