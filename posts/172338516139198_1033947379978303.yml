    message: "i don't remember anything saying they will review the app, that was
      a year ago, they might have changed their regulations. \nYou can also publish
      the app as closed beta, it will be on play store, people with invitations only
      can download it, using a custom link. Won't show in search."

    message: I also suggest publishing it in beta so you can choose testers to download
      and help you test it

    message: and now Google play is reviewing the published apps before publishing,
      you have to submit a rating for your app to be reviewed before publishing
