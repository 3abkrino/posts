      Google didn't announce anything about TLDs except once, saying that they will rank .edu domains better in search results related to questions.
      So nothing special to say. but you should think in a different way. from user experience point of view, will you trust clicking a .me website more than a .com website? most people don't
      I also have a personal concern regarding the .me TLD; the .me is a ccTLD to Montenegro, which is misleading to search engines, they may rank you lower in Local egyptian searches as they believe you are targeting another country. You can just search with ".me domain meaning" to find that Google gives you as the best answer " it's a ccTLD to Montenegro"
      I recommend going with the .com with another domain name or at least choosing another global TLD.

      you wanna use for SEO. But for branding when somebody seeks a site, the *.com
      is always primary. Ahmed Salah Mahmoud Mostafa
