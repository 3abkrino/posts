  random ones "websites- android application - ios applications..etc" come in handy

      Having many filled slots in your Github history is going to look good indeed when someone looks you up. Some people might even take this as a positive sign regardless of the project.

      In fact, as a graduate, just having a github username might be a good plus in your CV, regardless of what's in it (given it's not too empty).

      But those are not the reasons I would do it for.
      I would do it for what it will lead to.

      When you are very familiar with Github, and you create stuff regularly etc., you'll start having more confidence commenting on issues that address problems you face in some libraries, then creating issues yourself, and/or creating docs (typo/grammar) pull requests.

      This will later lead you to create tiny code fix pull requests, which might end up with your name as a contributor to big open source projects, along with great experience too.

      Eventually you might even get hooked into a big project (of your own, or existing one you join), and introduce yourself as a maintainer of big project X.

      But you need to take the first step, which is spending more time on Github, and random stuff will do just fine for this.
