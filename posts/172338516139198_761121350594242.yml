message: I have a thought that I wanted to share with you guys. Does it make sense
  to build a recurring subscription for businesses in MENA? Something like Recurly
  and Chargify? From our experience people like Payfort don't give you this stuff
  out of the box.

      & take the risk. I will list the list of problems that should be solved.\n\nBig
      part of it is about legal restriction, but mobile carriers want to get into
      this area. \n\nCash is still the dominant payment method, but my impression
      is that the upper class is increasingly using credit cards.\n\nI suggest that
      you initially launch in the gulf. They've the money!\n\nMohammad Al-Ayouti (of
      Vodafone) may give you good insight as well."

    message: "I'm not suggesting building a payment gateway like Payfort or Gate2Play.
      \ We are working with Payfort for our billing system. But we had to do all the
      logic related to \n\n- Creating different pricing tiers\n- Charging people in
      each pricing tier the correct amount\n- Sending emails confirming the charge
      has been done\n- Managing people upgrading/downgrading their plan\n- Issuing
      invoices\n\nMy understanding is that Chargify and Recurly do this stuff regardless
      of your payment gateway."

    message: This is not the point. The issue is if you are trying to build a SAAS
      business like UserTalk, you'll have to write a lot of code that manages billing
      users on a monthly basis and invoicing them. Payment gateways don't really offer
      this out of the box. Hence the existence of businesses like Recurly and Chargify.
      I was asking if building something like this would be viable in the Middle East.

      model?". I don't have an immediate answer.

    message: I still believe that even for companies that DO NOT use a subscription
      model, building something on top of Payment gateways that can integrate to your
      system and give you good reporting on your transactions could be useful.

    message: Muhammad Saleh not really like it. This seems to be geared more towards
      managing your user profiles. Recurly and Chargify are more related to recuring
      subscription billing
