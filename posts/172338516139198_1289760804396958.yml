      There are many factors that affect someone's hourly rate, but the key factors are: 1) specialty 2)  Experience 3) Quality
      For the specialty and experience parts, you really need to check the average salaries yourself.
      The quality part depends on what added value you offer, what distinguishes you from others and how much you would pay for a work like yours. Be aware that going too low might give a negative intuition about you and/or the quality of your product.
      A simple answer would be (1 and 2) + 3 = Value.
