message: "I have a question for network gurus..\nA company has an old Cisco infrastructure,
  they are planning  for network upgrade.\nThe network has about 250 servers/clients,
  the topology is spread on five building in the same place, with fiber cables in
  uplink...\n\nI have two questions: \nfirst which vendor is better, Cisco, Hawaei,
  or juniper....\nSecond, how can you choose the series of switches and routers for
  a medium sized network? \nthank you in advance."
