  Anyone tried to install Hyper-V inside another Hyper-V ?

  the scenario : i have an Azure VM running Windows Server 2012 , i have added the role for the Hyper-V(include Management Service) from the command line, after restart i couldn't find any way to open it however the Services is running in the Taskman , i want to run the Windows Phone 8 SDK Emulator inside this VM but it failed because one of the Hyper-V component can't started.

  Any Ideas to solve the problem would be appreciated.
