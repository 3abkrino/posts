  Windows is suggesting to Back up my File Encryption Certificate and Key, while I didn't create any certificates ... should I be worried ??!

  What I found is suggesting to delete those randomly created certificates, while no clues how they got created ! https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/00291b25-6610-4563-aceb-2acc737b9cfa/prompt-popping-up-to-back-up-file-encryption-certificate-and-key?forum=win10itprogeneral

    message: I think I've seen this twice before, I have two files in my "random"
      folder named something like "certificate backup thing". No idea what it is,
      I thought it might have to do with developing Universal Apps because there you
      create a certificate in order to install the app locally for testing, but I
      could be wrong, it's a random guess :D
