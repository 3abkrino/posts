message: A post on a friend's message board claims that Signal Messenger use is being
  blocked within Egypt.  I can find no (English language) reports of this in the news.   Is
  this the experience within Egypt?

      As per this post (in Arabic) there is no clear understanding of what's happening, it works sometimes and gets blocked others as per ISP and timing; but what's confirmed is that the website is blocked whispersystems.org by local DNS servers

    message: I experienced this my self, it fails to deliver messages most of the
      time with a "Failed to send" error, a friend told me the same, but surprisingly
      it delivers some old messages with few days delay.
