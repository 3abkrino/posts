message: "SA,\nI'm having a serious problem guys.\nI developed a big system (took
  me 1 month of full time development) using JavaFX.\n\nToday the client decided that
  she wants it as a web page.\n\nI've tried all day to embed the JavaFX app in the
  browser using webstarts and it's an epic fail.\nExpensive certifications are needed
  (self signing doesn't work) \nPLUS Google Chrome doesn't support java anymore for
  security issues.\n\nAny suggestions? If the only solution is to keep the models
  and database, and rewrite the controllers and views; What is the easiest Java web
  framework to re-implement the system?\n\nThanks in advance."

      the first place at least for dependency injection.
