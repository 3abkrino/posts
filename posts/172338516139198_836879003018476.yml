  Guys, has anyone used arvixe.com for ASP.NET hosting before ? If yes, is it good ? if not, please suggest a shared hosting provider that is good regardless of price. ( must support multiple subdomains or at least allow buying extra subdomains hosting )

  Thank you

      Arvixe is excellent and recommended from most of open sources projects, excellent support, specially for shard hosting.
      Softsys is perfect in VPS and dedicated , v. Good prices , but takecare each addon with additional cost and you have to managa everything (SW & configurations)
      Another perfect shared hosting discountasp but i like Arvixe more

      decided to go arvixe. the only thing i found at arvixe than anyone else is the
      sheer simplicity in deploying websites (even under the same domain/account)
      you just filezilla what's in your local directory and it'll work.\n\nthe good:
      price, fast support, amazing flexibility in creating sub sites, databases and
      sub domains on the same account without paying anything else, \n\nthe bad: i
      feel like it's not secured like ppl said but i guess this is a universal problem
      not on in arvixe. i'm talking about the shared hosting here not dedicated or
      vps.\n\nif you need anything, you know where to find me :D"

      Shared hosting sounds risky because it had more users, but this doesn't necessarily mean it has to be. Good companies put good use isolation and during security measures in place, very strong that they can be limiting in terms of what you can do with your site, which is when you go to VPS or dedicated.

      They also use commercially supported monitoring and management tools, like WebsitePanel for managing users and isolations. They make sure they have the latest versions of these tools and have all the update for them as well for the host Windows OS so any discovered vulnerability is patched quick enough that it doesn't affect the users.

      Of your hosting company is not doing that, they are not doing their work.
