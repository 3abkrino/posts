message: "Hello guys \nI'm a backend developer who works on a react app, I just have
  a couple of questions regarding react best practices \n\n1-what is the best place
  to store user data, I'm already storing user jwt token in local storage but what
  about the rest of the data like email, name, etc.. \n2-is it good to put the whole
  logic of a single component in one file? I.e validation /creating /editing and deleting
  in the same file plus the jsx\n3-any recommend pancakes for making the workflow
  easier for making common tasks like validation \n4- what is the best way to make
  helper class and global variables in the whole application? \n\nThanks in advance."

    message: "1- Don't use local storage. You can just use Redux with react and save
      all data you need in redux store. \n2- it depends on your approach. If you will
      continue using redux you willâ€‹ have the logic in separate files\n3- for validation
      you could use redux-form it is very easy and great in handling forms\n4- try
      to avoid using global variables. For helpers it is good to have helpers directory
      where you can store all helper and import what needed in each component"

      1. Jwt is how u pack/unpack secure msg between server and client. U dont relie on it. Save ur token on localstorage and ur client can load it and decrypt on runtime
      2. Use redux, and follow real-world-example react boilerplate. Or any good boilerplate it will teach u about best practises
      3. Make ur own libraries that do tasks that u consider routine/retepativei recommend u dont use high level libraries like 'redux-form' etc cause u need to learn about es6, functional programming, lib reusable code, if u gona be a react dev
      4. Best way is to make a helper class using 'Singleton pattern' and share this singleton either by passing it down props or by importing singelton from each file
