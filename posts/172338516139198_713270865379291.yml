      I really recommend you pick up at least two books and work your way through them. There is also the rails tutorial http://ruby.railstutorial.org/
      For the books, I recommend agile Web development in rails 4, that's a must have, must read.
      And Crafting rails 4 applications: Expert practices for everyday rails development will give you some good ammunition
