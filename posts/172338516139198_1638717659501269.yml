message: عندي سؤال في الويندوز...دلوقتي كارت الشاشه مش بيكون متعرف في اغلب الاحوال..هل
  فيه default renderer شغال عليه الويندوز ، بحيث انه يتكلم مع الGPU و يرسم الايقونات
  و الحاجات دي علي الشاشه ؟ بمعني اخر ، هل الGDI بتبقي هي الdefault سوفتوير ريندرر
  ؟ ولا الدايركت اكس؟ ولا فيه سوفتير رندرر مكتوب يتكلم مع كارت الشاشه ؟ بس لو فيه
  سوفتير رندرر مكتوب ازاي بيتكلم مع الGPU بدون اي driver ؟

      Sometimes your builtin gpu is the one that handles these so called basic rendering jobs when you haven't installed your dedicated GPU drivers. So there is probably a default GPU most probably the intel one handles that.

      One more thing, I do not know how but people tend to reverse engineer GPU drivers to know which address refers to which operation or command etc .. So you can do it like most linux geeks do .. I do not know how to be honest that exceeds my knowledge.

      Theoratically the GPU can be accessed via known addresses to perform specific commands or tasks. Only the vendor or the manufacturer knows that and keeps it secret but you can reverse engineer the driver software and know which address maps to which functionality.

      There are generic drivers that have the basic minimum communication with any Windows-supported graphics card, so in order for a graphics card to claim that it is Windows-compatible, it does not just submit a working driver, it needs to support the generic VGA driver.
      Most of the rendering is done on the CPU (software renderer), and the GPU is mostly eliminated in the process, the VGA card acts as a frame-buffer, a dump device that takes GDI bitmaps and pushes them to the Display.

      Yes GDI is the default, but your app can draw inside your window using Direct2D or Direct3D
      GDI abstracts all the Frames, Buffering, etc from your app.
      Note that GDI can just draw anywhere. DirectX or OpenGL needs a specific area or screen (Because it talks to the video driver of that screen)

      Windows and Icons are drawn using GDI API as well, so I don't think it is a pluggable component
