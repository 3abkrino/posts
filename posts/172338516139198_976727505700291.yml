      Job titles are not standard. A job is better defined by it's job duties. Different companies make up titles all the time.

      In some companies, they call the senior programmer a programmer analyst, or a system analyst. Some might call an architect or some sort of leader/mentor the same. You better check the specifics of the company (or person) that used that term.

      Business analyst is the person who talks to users / stakeholders and creates the project requirements in a form that programmers can easily used to build (user stories or whatever the company needs). You'll see business analysts in software companies working with salespeople and / or project managers to form the proposal and requirements later.

      Also in big companies (banks, universities, etc) that build software in house typically the product owner (the person interested most in the project and benefiting the most from its success) a very busy person, so s/he might have one or more business analysts to talk to the involved employees and/or users and make the requirements for the project (sometimes labeled "product owner proxy" which is not a role).

      Most business analysts are ex-IT people who have found they are good with people, and tired of code (or other technical aspects depending on their old role).

      Most of the transitions from IT to management or sales or BA are internal. The company has a need for something, and not hiring actively for it yet. Someone stands up and acts in the role for a little bit, prove themselves, and then moves into the new role full time.
