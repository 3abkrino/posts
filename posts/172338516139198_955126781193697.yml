  I'm trying to make a simple (Check & un-check All) in a grid view with "AngularJS" but all examples that i found depends on ng-repeat which not my case.

  the issue is i used (ng-checked) to achieve my target but when the master checkbox is checked the child checkboxes not firing onchange event so i couldn't complete my task to make some changes depend on whether the child checkbox is checked or not

  live example:
