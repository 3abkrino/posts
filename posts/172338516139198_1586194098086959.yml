  Hello everyone,

  I connect to a remote server running Windows Server 2012 R2 using RDP, this server has a group policy that logoff the server if idle after 3 hours. I can't change this policy and I use this server for running overnight activities on Jenkins. Any way I can override this policy?

    message: "You can not modify it through Local Group Policy, it is inhereting from
      the Domain GPO\n\nBut every policy at the end is writing/modifying some keys/values
      in Registry, and you can edit registry if you have a Local Admin permissions
      \U0001F602\n\nSo if you searched for the registry location of this GPO, you
      can change/overwrite it to desired values. \nBut GPO is regularly updated, so
      it is better to re-overwrite every 1 hour for example (use schedule tasks) \n\nLast
      thing:\nThis is just an info \"which I don't know if it is still valid today\",
      we were using it in some administrative/management cases, and it is not allowed
      to bypass a Domain GPO \"it is totally your responsibility here\""
