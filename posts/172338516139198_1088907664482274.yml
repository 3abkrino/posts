      much better

      I've been using Go for almost 9 months till now and I've wrote a service using it which is currently in production. I like it. It's very fast, statically typed, nice tooling, awesome concurrency model and the community is great. I'm a bit disappointed with some things there though.
      I've never done machine learning before so I won't be able to help you in your choice, but if you ever decide to learn a new language I'd recommend go.
