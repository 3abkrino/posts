message: "Hey guys,\n\nThis is my first post ever here, hope to make some friends
  :)\n\nAnyway, you all know about SaaS solutions, i was wondering; is there is ANY
  Arabic SaaS apps ? I keep saying to myself \"Well, of course there are, many\",
  but nothing ever pop up to me online!\n\nI just finished one BTW, it's called \"Tamkeen\",
  it's a learning management Web App for training centers/academies, delivered as
  an online service.\n\nHope you have sometime to check it out and give me your feedback
  :) \n\ntamkeenlms.com\n\nThe #1 problem i am facing in MENA is that people are not
  open minded enough about the idea itself, i always get this from clients: \"ammm
  ... and MY DATA will be on your servers! \"\n\nSaaS solutions are just awesome for
  both the customer and the provider, but how can we help push the trust of the targeted
  customers to accept it and see its pros ?! Any one has any expertise in this area
  ?"
