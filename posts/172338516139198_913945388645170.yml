message: "Hey guys,\n\nThis is my first post ever here, hope to make some friends
  :)\n\nAnyway, you all know about SaaS solutions, i was wondering; is there is ANY
  Arabic SaaS apps ? I keep saying to myself \"Well, of course there are, many\",
  but nothing ever pop up to me online!\n\nI just finished one BTW, it's called \"Tamkeen\",
  it's a learning management Web App for training centers/academies, delivered as
  an online service.\n\nHope you have sometime to check it out and give me your feedback
  :) \n\ntamkeenlms.com\n\nThe #1 problem i am facing in MENA is that people are not
  open minded enough about the idea itself, i always get this from clients: \"ammm
  ... and MY DATA will be on your servers! \"\n\nSaaS solutions are just awesome for
  both the customer and the provider, but how can we help push the trust of the targeted
  customers to accept it and see its pros ?! Any one has any expertise in this area

      and whoever want to scratch anything online.\nyou can consider it as the Arabian
      Medium.\n \nbasically, the Arabian clients will have more concerns about how
      much will they pay for both 1 - developing and getting the product ready, 2
      - the operational phase ; hosting, supporting, maintenance etc..\nthe cloud
      still expensive, forget about heroku and the cheap dyno thing, once your database
      record's exceed the default amount, they will charge you more, they still the
      cheapest competitor I guess right there. anyway, the client still demands to
      not throw lots of cash on things he can't even understand.\nIMHO, you should
      be picky with your clients if you want to use the cloud instead of shared hosts.\nor
      use the shared host solutions for the فلاحين as I see lots of them want the

      the end, every thing in this discipline is a matter of tweaking the best/cheap
      - in price not value/ affordable/meaningful thing for the job.\nforgive any
