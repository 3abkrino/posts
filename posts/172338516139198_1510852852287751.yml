  I'm trying to use Hangouts Instance (the widget not the button) to integrate it with OpenEdx platform but I'm only able to use the button which isn't suitable for my case, I need a chat room for each course (the widget give you that), not a new instance created by each user clicking on the chat button. But I'm stuck with whitelisting my domain step.

  So I need to know what does it mean that you need Google to whitelist your siteâ€™s domain as a referer for Google Hangouts to work?

  And how to get past this in development phase (using the localhost) ?
