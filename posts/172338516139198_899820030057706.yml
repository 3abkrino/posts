message: "Hey fellow geeks, we built a content recommendation system that offers personalized
  recommendations from your content to your visitors, \n\nit works with Arabic and
  English content, and learns from the user behaviour to offer better results for
  returning visitors. \n\nWe're gonna be launching a beta in few days and we were
  wondering if there are website owners who would be interested in testing it out
  :) ?? (It's free BTW)\nhttp://adjoin.io/\nArabic version: http://adjoin.io/ar"
