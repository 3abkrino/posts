  Any suggestion about easy to use and user intuitive UI controls for asp.net MVC projects ?
  And if any open source projects used these ui controls?

      If you are happy to pay, Kendo UI.
      Otherwise maybe jQuery UI yeah. There are some HTML helper wrappers for it, but I suggest you use the JS stuff directly. We're using it in a very large banking project that has been going for over 2 years now.

      But I've a lot of problems when merging Jquery UI controls into my MVC project and i think it's about JS files conflict and i spend a lot of time try to solve why the control doesn't appear or work correctly,
      Any suggestions about linking JS files (Jquery , Jquery UI , other JS libs) without conflicts ?
      Thank's A lot for your collaboration :)

    message: I remember once I had a problem with jQuery UI not loading, turned out
      the original template added another jQuery reference in another place in the
      document after my jQuery and jQuery UI references, causing jQuery to be loaded
      twice and the 2nd one after jQuery UI.

    message: This is not jQuery UI specific, I lead the UI team in a very large project
      as I told you, and we developed tens of custom widgets on top of jQuery UI actually,
      even our application JS code is built using jQuery UI Widget factory. I'm also
      talking about 30-70 developers in Australia, US and India. It WORKS :)
