  Dears,
  In the light of the recent security breaches I started to think about using password managers :( even though I really hate the idea of a  central place with all of the passwords
  I wanted to know if you think it's a good idea to use a password manager or not ? Also is there a password manager that can change all of your passwords at once ?

      use a formula between the user name and the website instead
      or
      Use a password manager and save the passwords with extra character(s) or backwards ..etc
