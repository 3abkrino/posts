message: Guys does anyone have resources that i could use to learn Web dev both front
  end and back end. I've been opening CodePen alot lately and i always get astonished
  by the work posted there and i wish to learn how to do similar things. I've started
  learning Web dev numerous times but always get frustrated at some point and quit
  and i've never felt that my foundation is solid and positioning is always a problem
  for me, i have to try a couple of times before i get it right. So if you would help
  me that would be appreciated. Thanks in advance :)
