      I don't know anything about skeleton but I am sure it gives some styles to the html most used tags
      So this is so bad idea ..

      skeleton has smaller community and less 3rd party components if any, better legacy browser support, less components, less bulk.

      Side note: You can use 2 frameworks, but there is absolutely no point in doing that, except duplicate CSS that you don't use.
