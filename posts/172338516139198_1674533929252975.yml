  Hey guys. Those of you who moved to Germany, I need to ask about something. The company I signed a contract with now want to apply for a document (ZAV) for me, and asked for a copy of my university degree and, if possible, any work (experience) certificates, and that they're officially certified. Now from my research I know how to get the degree certified (it's needed for the visa anyway), but it seems getting work certificates certified is pretty much not possible.

  Anybody had to go through this? I would really appreciate any help since this is pretty much the only place that can help me with that.

    message: It should be possible. Simply contact the HR departments of the companies
      you worked for and ask them for a Certificate of Experience for you. It shouldn't
      be a big deal if you fail to do that for some of the companies though.

      as long as it has all the necessary info.

      I applied with English versions that were not certified at the embassy and that was enough. It is also worth noting that any course certificates you took other than the university courses, and that are related to your field of work would help your case.

      The same applies for certificates of learning languages.
