  Question (or maybe discussion) about privacy in freelancing websites.. why can't I apply via upwork without providing my profile picture for example?
  I feel like every step we take we expose our privacy in many ways..
  also if anyone knows a freelancing service that doesn't expose the privacy of the freelancers, tell us about it.
