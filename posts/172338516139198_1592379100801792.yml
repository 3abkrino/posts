      you can convert the target object  into json object and use jsonloader to import it.

    message: "I am not using threejs .. but what models are you talking about ?!!
      \nRemember that the model data should be separated from its transformations
      .. so if you put whatever model in the scene and made some transformations to
      it .. you should store its current transformations in a separate location.\nnow
      there are two ways .. either you get the final transformation matrix of the
      object and store it .. [4x4] matrix which contains its translation, rotation,
      and scaling information.\nsecond way which i like is to store the operations
      itself that has been done to the object (which will allow you later to implement
      undo functionality)\n- Put Model\n- TranslateTo x,y,z\n- Rotate Around x,y,z
      with rotation angle (with radians)\netc .."
