  Guys please help
  I have a Router (with wifi disabled) connected through LAN to an AP and then the rest of home devices connected to the AP
  I'm feeling something weird with the connection so I decided to make sure I'm not hacked
  I changed the wifi password so now only my laptop is able to connect
  Shouldn't I have just 1 MAC Address in the picture?
  when I refresh the second mac address  goes away then I refresh and it comes back.
