  Hello buddies,
  I have some questions for my friends who switched from PC to Apple.
  - How do you find it?
  - What do you think about Macbook Pro 15" or 17''? Do you recommend it for graphic and web design work?
  Thanks :)

      Alright, So I did it since 4 years ago. NOTHING TO COMPARE. Mac is really awesome! Knowing you it will help you a lot making Designs and coding them!

      You don't need 17" Macbook Pro. Just get a 13" and Connect it to extra Monitor. One thing I recommend is to buy your Macbook Pro Maximized. and You don't need a Retina Display :)

      And to be honest everything look more beautiful on mac
      I can say that most of the apps are higher in quality.. but I'm not a heavy mac user.. so you may want to consider more experienced members :)
