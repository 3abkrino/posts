    message: 1 year experience is too little for MBA .. U wouldn't learn much in an
      MBA without at least 4 or 5 years experience.. because MBA is not a regular
      masters degree.. its  a place where u bring ur previous work experience and
      share it with colleaugues from different industries so u can really build insight.
      first be a developer u can start focusing on agile methods etc. in your own
      company analyse the way they  work and come out with suggestions for improvement..
      this takes time a lot of time then u can go for an MBA and come back as a true
      leader
