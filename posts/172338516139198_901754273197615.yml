  Geeks, especially those with the sense of humour module installed.

  I found this very wonderful youtube channel containing many valuable video tutorials, I hope to share this with you in the hope that you will learn and make a Dua of understanding for me, but any good Dua will be great.

  For those who only understand specific atomic instructions:
  The Dua is not compulsory, you can watch the videos and it would be just something nice of you to do.

  The Python video is 11 hours long.

  It has many many courses including all types of JS :)
