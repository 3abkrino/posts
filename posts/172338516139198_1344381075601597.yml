      It is never too late to do something you love

      BUT

      Both gaming & cyber security have long learning curve

      You should take your time to decide which one is more "suitable to you" not just hot topic out there

    message: I think the more knowledge the better, having one years experience in
      any field is no big deal, maybe when you have experience with multiple fields
      you could use the combination of this knowledge to do something even better
      than you thought

    message: It is never late, i was a game dev for about 2 years and i left it to
      android dev. Its not exactly a career path shifting cuz u still in the field
      so every thing you learned will add up in a way or another

      Like others have said, it's never late.
      Also, there is nothing weird at being in two fields at the same time.
      Right now I'm doing both Game Dev and Web Dev for my Startup, I had to learn a lot of things in Web Dev (because it has been a long time since I last did it), and it was fun :)
      Also a few months ago I was doing a mobile app with Xamarin for a project in a part-time job, and I had to learn Xamarin almost from scratch, and it was also fun in a way :D

      So yeah, learn Cyber Security, learn anything that you find interesting, it will benefit you in one way or another :)
