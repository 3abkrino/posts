    message: "I worked a little with ES but I have no idea about these types of replication.
      Could you explain what are these types? \nAlso, can you tell us what you are
      using ES for? only search? data analysis?"

      Alaa, I think Instant replication is better than queue replication.

      And use cases depends on your situation, as you can use it to recover your ass if instance down or to load balance by write to master and read from secondary.. Etc.
