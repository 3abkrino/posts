message: "I'm having a trouble connecting my arduino uno to the ethernet using ethernet
  shield.\nThe situation is as follows: when i connect my arduino to the ethernet
  in a certain home network it works fine, when i try it in another home network\nit
  fails ! for example i try the built-in example DhcpChatServer and it's always stuck
  at \"Failed to configure Ethernet using DHCP\".\nBasically the laptop,arduino,ethernet
  shield and all the cables are the same in the two home networks. The only thing
  that's different is the router itself\nthat i connect my ethernet cable to.\n\nSo
  is there a specific setting in the router that i should check?\nor is it a compatibility
  issue (ethernet shields are not compatible with some routers)\nor maybe the shield
  is faulty?\n\nwhat i have already checked :\n1) No sd card is in the sd slot\n2)
  DHCP server is enabled in both home network's routers\n3) The 3 LEDs of the ethernet
  on the shield are on correctly \n4) when i tried the static ip (Ethernet.begin(mac,
  ip)) it gives out the correct Ethernet.localIP() but when i enter it in the browser
  it doesn't work"
