  sorry for the last post,
  i am making a project for kids to draw geometrical figures like rectangle or any other figure, now i am trying to add an action to select a figure then delete it or do any other action to the selected figure, i googled it and all answers lead to use a library called (vector) which i can`t use, so anybody can help ?
  i am using C++..

      a rectangle :)

    message: Well this is complicated. but if you need to do the entire thing manually
      keep in mind that you need to store the figures drawn as corner points so that
      you can then translate/delete or anything else. You would probably have an array
      of figures, each figure should be able to draw itself/translate itself/any other
      action. You need to redraw the entire list of figures each time you do something
      to a figure. This is as far as I can help since the question is very vague.
