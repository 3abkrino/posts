  For Go enthusiasts, or for people working with streaming textual data, I would recommend experimenting with Go's encoding/gob:
  https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/

  It's really very simply to use. It can encode any type of data, transform it to a stream of bytes, then you can do whatever you want with it (either send it over a network or save it to a file in a streamable fashion).
