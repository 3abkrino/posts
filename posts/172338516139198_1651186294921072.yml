message: "Good morning Geeks,\nSo I have been always interested in Networking and
  Penetration testing. But in the last few weeks the arduino really grabbed my attention.
  I am really excited about it. I am just wondering...\nDoes arduino have future in
  Egypt? Does AI and machine Learning generally have Future in Egypt? Also if I couldn'tâ€‹
  find work in Egypt . Is there a way that I can be a freelancer with that technology?
  I don't know how. \nPlease let me know your opinions and thanks"

    message: "I just have some notes about Arduino in general \n\nLearn Arduino for
      fast prototyping or help kids and hoppiest learn something new.\n\nIf you want
      to learn real embedded systems work please use Arduino board only without using
      their framework to learn the real thing.  The framework is abstacting a lot
      and this will not increase your embedded knowledge.\nTry to port a RTOS, do
      low level interfacing etc."
