  When I connected an iphone, a Samsung galaxy phone and a Vodafone USB at the same time, The iphone is way faster. I used Ookla speed test the and iphone speed is 11 MB/s.

  I think Vodafone are really giving precedence to the iphone, instead of this being a hardware limitation on the Samsung/USB modem. The Ookla test on the USB modem yields 4.5 MB/s, although in good conditions it should be around 7.5 MB/s (like very late at night).

  Did anyone else notice this?

    message: Or it could be just that iPhone hardware is getting better signal? Getting
      full bars is not an indication of your 3G connection speed strength by any mean
