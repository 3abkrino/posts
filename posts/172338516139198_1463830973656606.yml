  Alsalam Alikom, I'm posting a question hopefully I'm not violating the rules:
  First of all I'm junior so hopefully this point is taken into commenter consideration :)

  I been searching using mySQL official documentation, also googling about my case trying to find some post similar to my case but I failed to find something similar so that I couldn't learn the way of solving my problem,
   recently I posted question on dba.stackexchange.com but still guys there are not giving sufficient answers to my question, just telling some keywords that I'm trying and I'm still not reaching a solution to my problem with them because as I said I'm junior , sorry for the long introductory , here is the question:

  I have 3 mySQL tables as follow:
  T1 has (std_id as primary key, std_name) T2 has (course_code,course_name) T3 has (std_id, course_code) ,,,, I need to execute a select query using left join to show all students names that are registered in course that includes the word for ex "Java" in its name or in the course_name field.

  I tried the following but didn't work out:

  select std_name from T1 left join T3 on T3.std_id = T1.std_id and T2.course_name like 'Java%';

  I tried also other queries but it ends up show the name of all students but not the name of students registered in course that its name include "Java".

    message: What you miss is the join between t2 and t3 , update your statement and
      you shall get the results.

      Like Shady Abdel Aziz said, you need to join 3 tables together not 2 only. And since you need intersection, you don't need the left join. An inner join will do the job. Something like this should work for you:

      SELECT T1.std_name, T2.course_name FROM T1
      INNER JOIN T3 ON T3.std_id = T1.std_id
      INNER JOIN T2 ON T2.course_code =  T3.course_code
      WHERE T2.course_name LIKE '%Java%'

      Yes, another join was required and it works good now.
      Many thanks guys for your valuable reply.
