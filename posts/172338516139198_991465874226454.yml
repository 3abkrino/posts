message: '"Sundar Pichai, in one of his interviews, told that his parents, who were
  of a modest background, sacrificed a lot to ensure that he got all the facilities
  for education. They never had a car, or a TV and one of their bedrooms was their
  living room. Almost all the money that his parents had saved was used to buy tickets
  for Sundar to fly to the USA for his scholarship Masterâ€™s degree."'
