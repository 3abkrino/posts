  I need to run a logo-design contest for a usergroup I run. The prize will be a gift from one of our sponsors.

  I have been thinking. Maybe create a new post in my blog and email it to the group, allow users to use Disqus image upload feature to upload images as comments, and other users can upvote comments.

  This has 2 issues:
  1. It's not straightforward. I'll have to explain it and maybe users won't get it.
  2. Users will not get notified when a new logo is added to vote on.

  Any better way to do that?
  Preferably in WordPress, but totally open for other options.

      here is an example, I guess 99Designs is better but it requires higher budget.

      Thanks a lot.
      This is for a user group not a company. So there is that fun ownership factor that user group users come up with the logos and choose them, even if I don't get the best logo ever, as long as it comes from them, cool. Sorry for not making this point clear earlier.

      activity itself, as it's part of making the users own the celebration of the
      group anniversary,
