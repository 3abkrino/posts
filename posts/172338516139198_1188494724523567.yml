    message: "Xamarin is better if your background is C#, and also it's faster and
      has better performance because of it's compiled to native code.\n\nPhoneGap
      is better if your background is Javascript, but it's slower  and haven't access
      to all native features as it runs as a hybrid app \n\nI also suggest to consider
      Titanium as a JS based code, but run as a native app also not hybrid"

      PhoneGap performance is not good, you can always detect if the application is built using phone gap from slow navigation and delayed scroll.
      Xamarin provides a performance almost same as native apps.
      Both requires Mac to build the ios application but you develop using windows for getting the android application and once done just get a mac to build your app for ios.
      Lastly use Xamarin forms for cross platform , it will save you a lot of time.

      Xamarin delivers Native Apps
      PhoneGap help u quicker , better and has wide support "in the end its Javsscript"
      Both needs a Mac to develop "at least to submit to AppStore" however u can rent a mac in the cloud
