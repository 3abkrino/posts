  We've just finished a basic version of a new iOS game at eSpace. The game is an iOS clone of http://newgrounds.com/portal/view/620902 . Would anyone like to test it, please comment/message me your e-mail :D

  For the folks thinking about commenting "Why do Egyptian companies always clone games?", I personally coded the flash version, so nope, we're not stealing anyone else's work.
