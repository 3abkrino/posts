  I encountered a performance bottleneck with my new SSD and after a lot of diagnosing trials, it was for my surprise that my "Marvell SE9128 Sata 3 chipset" is the main reason :( ... If anyone of you is having a performance problems with Sata 3.0 SSDs, check your chipset first. To sum the result up for you,  Marvel is the worst.
