  OpenLayers is an Open Source Javascript mapping system. IMHO, It isn't getting as much attention as it deserves. I strongly recommend that you take a look at it before using Google Maps in your site/app

  Version 3.0 has been released in August 2014 and a few days ago version 3.2 has been released.

  It is always fun to check the example page to get a sense of what it is capable of.
