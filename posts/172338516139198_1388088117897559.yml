  I am trying to make camera app that detect faces using google mobile vision Api with a custom camera instance NOT the same in "CameraSource" in the google Api as i am making frames processing to detect colors too and with camerasource i am not allowed to get the camera frames. after i've searched for it and all the results i've got are about using mobile vision with CameraSource not with any custom camera1 Api. I've tried to make frame processing then detect the output pics but i can't make it work.
  So is there any way that i can link mobile vision with my camera instance for the sack of frame processing to detect faces with it? you can see what i've done so far in here: https://github.com/etman55/FaceDetectionSampleApp
