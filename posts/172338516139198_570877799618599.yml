    message: I also recommend Camtasia Studio.. Another humble (free) alternative
      is Windows Media Encoder (ALLAH yer7amo), I think it's name is changed now,
      but I could send you the good old installer if you need it

    message: The best is Camtasia Studio. If you are not interested in heavy editing
      features (e.g. can do with Movie Maker, which works for many people, like Mohamed
      Hossam, or if you are recording offline events with no editing, which my company
      has been doing for a while), you can get SnagIt for 1/6 the price (~ $50 instead
      of ~ $300). For free options, CamStudio seems to be the most common option,
      although doesn't work nicely with some microphones.
