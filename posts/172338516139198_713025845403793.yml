    message: i used SignalR , and worked like a charm for me + works fine on Mobile
      Browsers too. i liked it because it takes care of fall back for me. and make
      your code a little bit high level of abstraction.

      Yes, we built an entire platform in erlang with bindings for ruby and php via rest apis and websockets on the client side that falls back to flash then comet.
      Full support for IE8+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera. Why?

      Node is not a magic bullet :) its single threaded approach isn't novel either, non-blocking io and event loops models hit mainstream long ago. Node.js only made it accessible. You'll still need to implement a backend for the proper protocols/techniques (websockets, comet...etc) Or use a library, same applies for any other platform.

      We packaged the product commercially Mohammad Tayseer but it's been defunct for almost a year now so we might open source it.

    message: I think the best frameworks for this exist in .NET and Node. When it
      comes to old platforms compatibility you are already beyond simple solutions
      already most of the time, so, it helps to use a framework that covers the edges
      instead of rolling up something simple on your own.
