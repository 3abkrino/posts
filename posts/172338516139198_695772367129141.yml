    message: The most important thing for me the easiness of sharing which fb provides.
      I still see that the fb group has a great advantage which is the notification
      and we are regularly visits fb which granted that we will view the group content

      I went ahead and I created https://moot.it/egyptian-geeks
      It certainly fits the paradigm I presume a lot would be comfortable with but it doesn't have any options to turn it into a private board or something of that sort. Question is, do we need this? I'm all for keeping it public

    message: Oh no one is rushing, I've had my eyes on moot for  along time so figured
      it's a nice opportunity to give it a spin. I'm in favour of discourse, moot
      is a lot more slimmer though.

    message: Tarek Amr Don't worry we will have both. just we want to keep a record
      of our bookmarks and most important questions and answers so they don't get
      repeated and we found out that we do really well in responding questions so
      we want the benefit to be for EVERYONE :-)

    message: there are a bunch of reasons to think of migration, first facebook lack
      of indexing... or categorizing topics.. interests, the essential need for a
      bookmarks repository, creating a q&a section, job board... may be also a video
      repository (nice geeky hangouts). I think that move should be done to keep community
      healthy (getting red of bunch of spam marketing, spam messages too)

      this way we can notify every body anything we do in our website.
