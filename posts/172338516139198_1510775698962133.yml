    message: 'I am not sure I fully understand the question, but generally can you
      seat 20,000,000 persons on 300 rows each row has 400 seats while each seat capacity
      is one person? The answer is no, you need to have maximum of 120,000 persons.
      Device screen resolution is hardware limitation, these are the number of pixels
      available on the screen and each pixel can have one colour, that''s why you
      need to match to its resolution. The other problem you will face is that width
      / height ratios are different: 4/3 and 4/5, you may want to centre it and add
      padding to match the device ratio. You may still be able to keep the original
      canvas resolution (maybe in separate memory) and support zooming in to view
      the details with better quality. Implementation depends on what software stack
      you use. If you really need this higher resolution, then you need to get a device
      that supports this resolution and can show all these pixels.'
