    message: Best bet is checking the request http headers. This will not always work,
      if I want to counter being detected, I could mimic the same headers sent by
      the browser to trick you that I am the browser.

    message: Yea you can by checking the user-agent of the http request but if the
      user changes it, that won't work. So i suggest checking the request/response
      scheme as mobile app traffic may differ from web app traffic. For example a
      web application response usually contains html/js/css but mobile app response
      may contain only json data returned from an api and the client side of the app
      handles the way of showing it instead of css and html.

      Using the headers and user agent will need you to decrypt the https traffic or intercept it with your intermediary certificate that the end points trust.
      If you did not decrypt the traffic then your best bet will he the sni packet during tls negotiation which reveals the domain. Mobile domain is a subdomain from facebook
