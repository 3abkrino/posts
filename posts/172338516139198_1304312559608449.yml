  Hi there,
  I'm beginning to learn Prolog programming language, but my problem is that I don't know where to start ?!
  I knew that it derived from the predicate logic, so am I supposed to learn about it before or what ?
  up to this point, I tried to learn it from the documentation which comes with the visual prolog but, unfortunately, it is messy and the language seems to be mind-blowing to me !
  so, anyone here can recommend me any suitable books or tutorials for it ?

    message: I can give you my lecture slides if you want , but at first why would
      you like to learn it ? if you're willing to study AI most of the courses now
      are in Python , prolog is not efficient as modern programming languages , but
      if you're looking for understanding the logic programming concept just pass
      your course , and don't waste your time , this is my advice :)
