  Let's imagine a scenario where Google is determined to snoop on its users and violate their privacy(through Android) collecting data without permission, is there a way to prevent this other than just revoking its apps and services permissions?

  Since it's their OS, I imagine there is no way to really go around this other than trusting the company or stop using their OS. And yes it's a security concern triggered by Facebook probably doing this.

    message: "You cant compare android to facebook in this scenario , you can just
      remove app in facebook case \n\nIn android - and any other OS really - things
      are more complicated and let me take it even further and ask \" how governments
      all over the world trust microsoft and apple to not do the same and spy on their
      devices \" ? \n\nThe answer is you cant until you are permitted to run full
      audit on the software or have a third party hat both you and the vendor trust
      do it and i know that microsoft already have an program  that allow governments
      and certain individuals to review their source code just for that"
