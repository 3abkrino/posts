  This might be a weird problem and might have other alternate solutions, but this is just what I want to do, and I want to know any clues:

  - I don't want to cancel or disable automatic Windows update
  - I don't want to stop the update service
  - I don't want to install any firewall
  - I need to block the process from downloading or block its port temporarily whenever I need the network traffic it consumes (hint killing the process halts the system)

  Any ideas for commands or hacks for this?

    message: I've been looking into ways to avoid disabling the updates altogether
      but also stopping it from hogging all my bandwidth as well. Not sure if that'd
      work for you but one option I found is that you could throttle the amount of
      bandwidth it can use to download the updates via the windows group policy editor.

    message: In Windows 10, you can set Windows Update to not use "metered" connections
      to download updates, then set your connection to metered whenever you want the
      bandwidth, then set it back as normal after.

    message: Assuming your DSL router is your home DNS resolver, can't you just create
      loophole/fake DNS A-host entries for the MS update domains used and point them
      to a wrong IP like your gateway's IP? Then you remove those entries when you
      really want it to update. Also, don't forget to set the DNS entries' TTL to
      a very low value so that once you delete them, the client can connnect immediately.
