  I'm getting (Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request) after about 10 minutes from running my php file, The page has a lot of CURL Requests in it, I have all timeouts and max execution time set to 0 :

  @ini_set('max_execution_time', '0');
  @ini_set('max_input_time', '0');
  @ini_set('mbstring.func_overload', '0');
  @ini_set('output_handler', '');
  @ini_set('default_socket_timeout','10');
  @ini_set('memory_limit','512M');
  @set_time_limit(0);

  And still getting the same error.

  * This problem only happened when number of CURL Requests raised means it was working till yesterday and I'm pretty sure the code has nothing wrong with it.

  any Ideas ?
