  Good evening gentlemen .
  I'm developing a simple game that requires user's interaction , however i've set the main function to be called and ready whenever the page loads , the catch is that every time the user clicks , it reloads  and i want to know how to prevent the function from re running while it already is .
  it is written in javascript .
  Thnx in advance
