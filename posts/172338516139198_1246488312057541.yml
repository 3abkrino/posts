      In current law there is no mention to using Tor or VPN services but  they declare that its illegal to encrypt your connection.

      In the new law using Tor , vpn and proxies is totally illegal.

    message: Finally, even if you are tempted, doing something illegal while come
      back and bite you, you never know if your browser, even tor, doesn't have a
      back door, and I am sure you won't know how sophisticated the people who can
      watch you are, until it is too late. So, don't play with fire to inflate your
      ego my friend, just a word of wisdom.

      no one is watching you or that you are browsing privately until you understand
      how things work, otherwise it is you who are making dangerous assumptions,

    message: 'about the privacy tor gives you, once read that: no one will know what
      you really do when you''re using tor. but consider everyone in egypt using normal
      plain text connections or even https and then your TOR traffic appears between
      those, then TOR will bring more eyes towards you than hiding your identity.'
