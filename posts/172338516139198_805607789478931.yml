message: "The Problem: \nA huge SQL Server database for government sector get grows
  by huge amount of data every 2 months.\nSo they move the completed transactions
  to backups every 2 months to make the business solution working fine and faster.\nBut
  when they try to search or making some business upon old transactions they enforced
  to extract the old transactions from old backups and move it to production DB.\nThe
  Question: what is the best solution or way to automatically extend the current SQl
  Server database to multiple database automatically every period time and the custom
  business solution can deal with them all."
