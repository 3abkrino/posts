  In light of a previous discussion about "trivial" posts, and because this particular issue is a common occurrence, please allow me to introduce the XY Problem to those who are unaware of it.

  Generally, it goes like this:
  - User wants to do X.
  - User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks it is achievable via Y.
  - User doesn't know how to do Y either.
  - User asks for help with Y.
  - Others try to help user with Y, but are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve.
  - After much interaction and wasted time, it finally becomes clear that the user really wants help with X, and that Y wasn't even a suitable solution for X.
