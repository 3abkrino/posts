    message: You can get the day, month, year and day of week using the methods that
      get these in the class, then get the days of the month using month and year
      you have, and create your UI based on that.

      You just new it. Look at this example: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.hijricalendar.getmonth(v=vs.110).aspx
      Replace myDT with something like DateTime.Now (if there's such in WP8) and continue with the rest of the xample

      and go down to the example you'll see how to create it, which is just `new HijriCalendar()`

    message: "Abdullah El-menawy Do you know XAML well ? If so , it would be easy
      for you to create / customize an existing code to fit your needs. You will use
      grid , some stackpanels , buttons and some data binding :)\n\nAlso if you aren't
      looking for a very specific features , you can use some f the available controls
      \n\nCheck this project :\nhttp://wpcontrols.codeplex.com/\n\nTelerik also provides
      a calendar control that you can use if you have access to Telerik Controls\n\nhttp://www.telerik.com/products/windows-phone/overview/all-controls/calendar.aspx\n\nAlso\n\nhttp://maheshprasad.blogspot.in/2010/12/calendar-control-for-windows-phone-7.html\n\nGoogle
