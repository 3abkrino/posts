  This is probably out of the group scoop but hopefully someone can help,
  i used to purchase from the U.S and pay with my Egyptian paypal account, but when making a purchase today they couldn't accept my paypal account, because paypal shipping address is in Egypt, even i will have the order shipped to U.S address.
  ملهاش حل دى ؟
