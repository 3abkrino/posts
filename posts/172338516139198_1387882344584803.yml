  Morning peeps .. Would you please help me report this profile? He's been spamming our company's facebook page (WBN) for a while now by checking in and sharing it, although I've banned him (I don't know how he's still able to do that!).

  If there is ANY way I can prevent him from doing that, please #HELP!!!

      I don't understand, you're saying he's spamming by "sharing and checking in" on his own timeline?! How is that considered spamming? As long as he's not able to post or interact with the posts, then the banning actually works!

      Please correct me if I misunderstood

      I assume you are talking about a business page, so there's really nothing you can do to stop him from seeing the content, sharing it and checking in the business, he's spamming his own friends, not your page. That's actually how it works.
