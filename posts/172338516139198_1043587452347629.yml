  Real world examples are appreciated.  Thanks

    message: "I'll tell my side of the story as I asked the same question and why
      bother spending time on writing tests rather than diving in the functionality
      code it self.\n\nTo summarize there is two major reasons I benefited from writing
      and maintain tests covered code:\n1. On the process it self you will be forced
      to break down hypothetical function to testable small pieces witch actually
      eases later on writing the functionality it self \nExample : \nWrite a function
      calls api retrieve data according to a parameter and returns filtered results
      according to another parameter.\n Tests:\n1. Function exists\n2. Can call api
      with 200 response \n3. If parameters type are wrong or undefined\nEtc.. \nWhen
      your write your function later it will be a walk in a park because you're already
      know what to do.\n\n2. Second major reason is simple to have as much as you
      can code base covered with tests so when every time you add one more feature
      you will make sure it doesn't ruin something else."
