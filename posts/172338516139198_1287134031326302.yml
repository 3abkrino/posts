  I made this selector $('ul.links li a') with jQuery; to load content of the page using a AJAX. The problem is when I select the parent of this selector to add a class, I get array of list items

      instead of console.log(link.parent('li')); use console.log($(this).parent('li'));

      This selector $('ul.links li a') retrieves a list and this is normal :) in the event use this not the link variable to refer to the clicked Anchor

      What load method does: Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element.
      Which means that to take plain html and use it. you should remove .col-md-9 from the called page html.
      Also the way you're using this isn't the best there are many frameworks that do what you want to achieve like angular routing etc.
