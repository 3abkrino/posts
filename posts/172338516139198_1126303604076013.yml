message: "I need your opinion about cheapest Parse replacement. I investigated a lot
  in this topic but what I was getting as free at Parse will cost me now 100-200$
  monthly in alternative solutions. \nrequirements:\n- I serve 4 million requests
  per month serving only 20 000 users\n- db is 2 GB\n- I use cloud code / scheduled
  jobs / push notifications / social authentication.\nNumbers mentioned above will
  increase with the increase of users.\nHope you can help. Thanks in advance."

      What about your own parse server??
      It's not a big deal and I think you will only lose the push notifications which is easy to use any other alternative for it.

    message: I was with that option until I faced a situation where scheduled jobs
      stopped working and Parse support team was a life saver for me. If I faced this
      situation alone, my app would die. and I dont have that much time to do everything

      I don't have a big apps like you guys so I don't see it that way and one server is enough for me to be an alternative for Parse.com
      I think we learned a hard lesson with Parse so let's try not to use full BaaS for our Apps.

      Ya H, Amazon Offers AWS Mobile Hub, where you can live one more free year considering your numbers. They have Cognito for authentication, Lamda for cloud cod, SNS for push notifications. Have a look:

    message: 'seems that there is not a lot here faced the issue. I hoped to get a
      lot of answers based on real experience. Anyway, Here is most propaply my final
      decision after days of investigation. firebase is not suotable. amazon is powerfull
      but complex and has more cost if you pay as you go and didnt pay first. google
      app engine is easy and cheaper and will become more cheaper on Acoming July.
      hosting parse server on my responsibility is very risky for my buisoness. so
      final decision is : in short term: continue on parse for next 1-2 month.  then
      host parse on Back4app.com which manages parse for you and add missing parts
      but cost more money. long term to seitch to google app engine and write missing
      parts with integration with other systems that cover mossing parts such as onesignal.com
      for push notifications'
