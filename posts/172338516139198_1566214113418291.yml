message: "Hello everybody, \n\nI am creating an IOS app that will have a Laravel backend.
  I need to include the admin panel in the IOS app. I can do it just using a web page
  but are there any better solutions? are there some requirements on the backend side
  such that it gives me more options of including that admin panel in the IOS app
  such as providing API for it?\n\nThanks in advance."
