  Hi, when a member clicks "Resend Verification code" which is better to generate a new code and send it or resend the last created code.
  thanks in advance.

    message: First make sure that all generated codes / tokens have short lifetime
      and can only be used once, for example the code lifetime can be 30 mins, within
      the same 30 mins you can resend the same code again if the user hasn't received
      it, and it can't be used again if it was already used before.

    message: Better to send the same code if its not expired as u may encounter a
      delivery delay.

    message: put a flag ( boolean) isUsed and check if it is used ... when they click
      resend it's more secure if you change it but you may encounter delay issue...
      so you can  put a wait process between each sending 10 to 15 minutes maslan

    message: Well look at fb and twitter and other fams who made 2 fac auth, they
      generate every time and deprecate every code, even if not used, there's no gain
      from trying to optimize, if facebook/google/twitter/amzn wanted to optimize
      trust me they can, if you're not sure, just follow the lead.
