message: "\"The Arab Spring revolution was sparked and fuelled through social media
  sites like \nFacebook and Twitter. Over the next few days, social media went from
  being just \na means of interacting with family and friends to a weapon that empowered
  the \npeople and brought about a significant change in the world. Everyone noticed
  the \npower of the people and people noticed what social networks were capable of.
  At \nthe heart of it all was the technology that made all this possible, the technology
  that \nremoved all the barriers to communication and spread the word faster than
  wildfire. \nThis is the power of real-time web!\"\n------------------\nSocket.IO
