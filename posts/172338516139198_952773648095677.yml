  For PHP Developers who compare between "Netbeans", "PHPStorm", and "SubLime" as a code editor ... My opinion is:
  Netbeans sucks...
  PHPStorm is professional but heavyweight...
  Sublime wins the battle among all....
  What do you think?

    message: I exclusively use Komodo Edit now. I have no idea why people use NetBeans
      and I used to love Sublime but sadly had to give it up for its lack of RTL languages
      support which I need.

      For PHP IDE .. PhpStorm wins, For a text Editor Sublime is the best out there but i guess for not so long as atom is growing really fast and github is supporting it and its Open source.
      Simply as a web developer i need both daily .. for heavy work in adding a new big feature and need some IDE features to inject in my whole project directory PHPStorm is unbeatable at this point, in the other hand if i wanted to edit a PHP file on the fly under a hotfix or something sublime is really fast and can be more than enough for this cases.
