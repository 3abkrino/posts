  Hey guys,

  I have a question in web application. I dont really have much experience in web app development and I am having a vendor building a portal for me at work and we are facing an issue. I tried most of the solutions I was able to get from google but nothing is working.

  The issue here is that the user would click on a button which would spawn a thread running a processing intensive function that could take up to 15 minutes to complete. At the same time, it would redirect to a different page.

  So We always end up getting ThreadAbortException. We tried to specify "false" as the second parameter to the Redirect function and also calling HttpContext.ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest() but still getting the same issue.

  Any suggestions?
