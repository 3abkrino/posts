    message: umm, nice article that will be very useful in the days to come :D but
      ... probably I'm missing something; Towards the end of the article, the writer
      has mentioned "OpeVPN through SSH Tunnel"  .... why would one need to use a
      VPN (for the purpose of hiding traffic) along with an SSH Tunnel ? (shouldn't
      the SSH Tunnel be sufficient to encrypt all the traffic? specially if done through
      something like SSHuttle? )

    message: That's to masquerade the VPN connection since DPI in the mentioned countries
      has blocked it.

    message: Yes I understand that this is the goal of the entire article anyways.  But
      I'm just wondering if the SSH tunnel by itself is just sufficient to bypass
      DPI? I've always thought that the SSH Tunnel is some sort of a *secure* channel
      as all the packets between the two hosts are encrypted by default,  in which
      case is a VPN just an overhead (given how stupid connections in Egypt are already
      :D)  or is it still absolutely required? ...  (this is quiet different from
      asking why should I care about masquerading my VPN traffic though; I do appreciate
      that part but am a little confused about the other one about combining SSH tunneling
      and VPNs). Really appreciate your time :)
