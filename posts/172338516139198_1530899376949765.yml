    message: "you can use OAuth/OpenId and IdentityServer3 (don't use 4 since it's
      for aspnet core and won't work with MVC 5). \n\nThe solution would work in a
      similar way to the \"new project\" template ins visual studio having facebook/twitter/etc.
      But instead of twitter/facebook/etc, you use generic oauth server. You create
      a web application that will be your oauth/openid server. The website authenticates
      users with windows authentication. Then issues a token if the user is authenticated,
      and redirects the user back to the main web application. IdentityServer3 handles
      the creation and validation of oauth/openid tokens and the redirection. The
      Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect or Microsoft.Owin.Security.OAuth package
      will handle the authentication/challenge on your application side."
