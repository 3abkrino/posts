message: "Hello, If anyone has some experience with Mongodb \nI have 2 user and foo.
  \nwhen I create a new foo it gets a user id.\nI end up with many foos belonging
  to the same user, I need to find a way to keep only one foo per user \"keeping the
  2 collections convention\".\n\nI thought of creating a cron job to find the subtraction
  of the two sets but I think I wrote a really slow query...\n\nCan anyone help me
  for reaching a better way ?"
