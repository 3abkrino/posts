message: "Slam All , \n\nI have a question for Java developers : \n\nCan spring boot
  and Angular 2 build big huge project without technical long term issues ? \n\nAnd
  what are the common problems that may facing that kind of project with these technologies
  ( if any ) ?"

    message: "The logical answer will be \"it's up to your project scale and business
      requirements \" .\ntechnologies you mentioned are widely used. \nI think they
      have all aspects you should be concerned about . Usage Context : they are popular
      with a solid communities for support and ready implemented components for integration
      ( you are not forced to build everything from scratch) and learning curve will
      be high here .\nDesign pattern: you can follow mvc pattern easily using these
      frameworks for easy maintenance and scalable project.\nLicense: both are open
      source \U0001F4AA.\n\nThey are many other factors to choose your frameworks
      you can check it here \nhttps://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/15-important-considerations-for-choosing-a-web-dev-framework--net-8035\n\nFrom
      my perspective is just to keep the angular js 2 for the front end layer , replace
      the spring boot with normal JEE micro services . \nActually spring boot support
      micro services but i like the standard JEE more easy and lightweight. \nHowever
      spring boot will provide a lot of ready for using components for security (
      authorization,..) but you can also use other open source solutions like keycloak
      for security . \nLast thing to mention here that you need to focus also on the
      project architecture ( which dbms to use , app server , using multiple clusters
      for servers and db , ...) \nThe process to get the feature from development
      to production . \nBecause not only the framework affect the project performance
      and productivity. \n\nRbna m3ak :D"
