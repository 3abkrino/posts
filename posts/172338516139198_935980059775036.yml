  Hello Geeks,

  I have an application where I use full text search on sql server 2008 R2

  The text to be searched is in Arabic.

  Everything is fine and FTS is working except that a word with "ุฃ" does not match the same word with "ุง".

  Is there a default setting in FTS to make these words match or I have to implement it manually ?
