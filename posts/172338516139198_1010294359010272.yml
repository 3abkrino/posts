  Has anyone heard anything about or used GNU Health?

  http://health.gnu.org/

  I was working on simple web app that I was planning to open-source for managing medical records for small clinics and such (because a lot of people are still using paper records which is terribly inconvenient for everyone)

  Then I stumbled on this, which seems to be an open source medical record and management software. Haven't tried it, curious if anyone has any thoughts!
