    message: mongodb has serious problem with performance unless you are using it
      for a big, huge project it's fine. but if it's a small project don't use it.

      As big as big can get, every stack has its set of problems to deal with when you scale. Can you scale mongo? yes, can you scale python? yes. At what cost (effort, time, sanity)? Depends.
      Don't think about scalability now. There will always be a bottleneck somewhere, it'll show itself when the time comes for it.
