message: "Hello, \nI have a question about Google AdWords\n\nI have an Ad that when
  users click on it, it redirects them to the company's page.\nafterwards, the user
  go through a process that ends up with storing his info for a later process.\n\nafter
  that, an offline tool acts on each one of the users info, giving them a rating depending
  on the decisions they took through the process.\n\nI need to some how attach this
  offline rating to the glcid to be able to track users through \n\ni can manually
  connect each customer with his corresponding rate  by saving their referring data
  when they first come to the site, but I would like it to show up in my google adwords
  / analytics account where it is easier to manipulate the data and see trends.\n\nAfter
  investigating, i found there is only one way to store custom data, with the custom
  variables, but that couldn't help as i need it to be done after running the offline
  tool\n\nis there a way to do that ?"
