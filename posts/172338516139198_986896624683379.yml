message: Thanwya amma graduate here, will be attending Ain Shams University (hopefully),
  I'd like your opinion on website/s from which I could self study programming languages,
  there's corsera, khan academy, coder and code. If there are better ones, kindly
  drop them in a comment down below. Also I'd like to ask if we're taking c++ in the
  first semester (for example) should I pre-study c++ or go for another programming
  language instead? Thanks in advance!
