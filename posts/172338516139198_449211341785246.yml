      I would use the autocomplete plugin: on document.ready:

      $('#yourTextBox').autocomplete({ source: 'yourServiceOrPageUrl', minLength: 3, delay: 50 });

    message: i'm using this in wordpress and it's working my only problem is that
      if you fire 4 ajax calls they start in sequence and what i need is to cancel
      the other calls before starting the new :S

      OK, googled it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1802936/stop-all-active-ajax-requests-in-jquery

      But this is not the only problem/bug you will get, autocomplete is very much more better

    message: 'I second Moutaz  suggestion of using autocomplete, but if you want to
      implement yourself, here is my solution: always send a timestamp to the server,
      and store the last timestamp. The server will send to you the response + the
      timestamp. When you receive the response, check the received timestamp with
      the latest timestamp you have, and only handle the response if the timetamps
      are the same'

    message: "better way that I've been using all the time is TO AVOID MAKING THE
      EXTRA CALLS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\nthis will improve the overall responsiveness
      of your code, and will lower the headache from your servers as well.\nhere is
      what I recommend you to do:\n1- Create a flag called 'callIsInProgress' \" var
      callIsInProgress = false\"\n2- Wrap your logic inside an IF statement checking
      if this flage is false. \nif(! callIsInProgress)\n{\n// your code\n}\n\n3- Before
      moving into your code, set this flag to \"true\"\n4- Do your work (and do it
      nicely) :)\n5- Inside the callback method, get the response, do your stuff,
      then reset this flag to \"false\" again, so you can handle any future calls.\n6-

    message: Mohammad Tayseer I don't like to use plugins. at the end of every big
      project you will find your self with more than 30 plugin and if you update jQuery
      one of the plugin might not work and then you start to get angry searching for
      a solution and sometimes changing your logic by this time is too late :)

    message: Mohamed Alaa this means that you will have to rewrite lots of code :)
      You need to spend sometime evaluating plugins & only plugins with good compatibility
      history should be used, or at least write your code as plugins & share it with
      us :)

      I have my own UI Library and i made them in a way to be extended :)
