  My team is writing a proposal for a project, and part of it will be about the cost of hosting the solution, the client wont handle the hosting and wants to know the cost with respect to the number of active users.
  I know that it varies widely depending on the provider and the code and the framework and a lot of other things, but I wanted to know if there is anything that could help me make a good rough estimate for the amount of concurrent users a certain cloud hosting tier can serve.
  Do I just look at benchmarks on techempower and compare the specs of the hardware used in their benchmarks with the hardware of the hosting tier? Are there commonly-known ranges of numbers for things like Azure App Service?

      written with go for example will take more uaers than an app written with rails,
      php, or python for example given same specs"

    message: Well let's say an ASP.NET Core application, and it's not real-time but
      very frequent, imagine like every time you take/consume an item in a game you
      have to send that to the server which might also make a quick check to make
      sure you're not cheating.

    message: There might be another part of the backend for real-time data, it could
      be a custom server that uses TCP or UDP sockets (that part isn't still decided
      yet). This one is easier to make assumptions for because there is a limit on
      how many simultaneous sockets a server can have.

    message: The only thing i can ask u is to add a charge per user for the contract,
      and get an average cost for the user fom a small scale, dont forget the indirect
      costs that grow with users like support cost.
