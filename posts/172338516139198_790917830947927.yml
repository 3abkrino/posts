  Beginner content is increasing. Should we limit it, given beginners -although are sort-of allowed in- are not the intended audience of the group?
  * The question is for experienced members and admins, not for beginner members *

      I vote for removing posts whose owner obviously has not bothered to even google their issue.

      Examples -at the top of my head-:
      - value vs. reference parameters
      - changing exe resources
      - database related exception

      Those are what sites like stackoverflow are for. Personally, I came here for geeky discussions/news or even personal projects. The keyword is "geek".

      Just my humble opinion.

      Sherif Omar We try to maintain Quality over Quantity in our Group and that's why we are not any random Forum or group and this is all the efforts of all the members in here and the admins. Allowing someone to post something without even bothering to google it is useless because:

      1. He actually don't want to learn anything, He wants you to solve his problem so at least you should charge him :)

      2. You are not helping him at all! you are giving him a chance to be more lazy.

      3. If he doesn't learn how to research and use his head what you are expecting from him.

      4. You have the Top people in the industry here in out group, Make use of them otherwise you will be like A man/girl who has a Mercedes and he use it transport vegetables!

      That's why we should not allow Random stuff in our group.

      Funny thing about discrimination and not encouraging.
      In short, you can think of any filter as discrimination, but I think you are using the word in the wrong context.
      Our *role* and the reason we are here is not encouraging beginners. We can send them to more beginner friendly group. We can even start one ourselves. This is not the point. Nobody said be rude to beginners and tell them they are stupid. Some day some of them will be pros, maybe more than all of us

      In my opinion, removing beginner content is wrong direction, because group is generally open, if admins want to remove beginners then they should ask for minimum requirements to be in the group. In fact, this question is extremely important and should be asked from along ago! Whats the purpose and direction of this group. (Closed group of  Uber Geeks, or Open Group for every one interested)
      N.B: Most famous geek communities and sites accept beginner content because simply its a part/step that cannot be ignored.

      From the very beginning most admins agreed that beginner content providers and groups are everywhere. Once you get past that, it's very hard to find a place which is not full of basic information only.

      Somehow, not sure whether by conscious admin effort or accidentally, more advanced  members joined and this place became an elite one that's different from all (respectable and useful, and many) beginner groups/sites.

      As we got biggerr, more beginners were interested in joining. They were welcome as watchers, but recently this is changing the nature of the group with their contributions, which may be good, but not for this very group.

      "Discrimination" is a really tough word in this context! You want to help "beginners"? Help them in communities created for that purpose.

      The way I see it, beginners won't die if this group eliminates their content and they -if they really want to learn- will find other places where they will get more help than we can even provide, but this group will die if we got too much "beginner content".

      And it is because of the facebook limitations that this problem has rised.

      Take Stack Overflow for example, what they did was brilliant, they eliminated the "noise".

      Before SO, you would have had to browse through forum thread pages, with all people saying "yes that's my problem too" and not really find a solution for the problem you are trying to solve. SO created a comprehensive community based reputation system to squeeze out only the "good content" and to make "noise" less "visible" and less "important". If that's "discrimination", I want it please :)

      In my opinion, for this group the "noise" is "beginner content". And if you keep the "noise" one day it will end this group!

      Another example of a system designed to eliminate noise is Reddit!
      I've been lurking or various subreddits for some time and I really started to like their self-moderating system, moderators still interfere but it's much less often than with regular forums, some subreddits also allow categories [Like This] in the title and people can get flairs that describe them.
      I always felt that this group would be great as a subreddit but sadly reddit is very uncommon in Egypt so we will be severely limiting the audience :\

      انا عن نفسي شوفت حبة جروپس للمبتدئين شغالة و مركزة علي العربي كمان، ده مثال كويس:
      https://www.facebook.com/groups/Egy.VCS.Dev/
      بس لو فيه ناس كتير شايفه ان الجروبس التانية وحشة اوي يبقي في الحالة ده ممكن نعمل (و نمودرايت) جروب تاني للمبتدئين، عشان مشكلتنا هنا هي ان بقى صعب اوي ان الجروپ تستوعب النوعين من المحتوى (و فايسبوك مش مساعد على الكلام ده).
      و بالنسبة لموضوع العربي و الإنجليزي ده، اظن ان ده موضوع تاني، انا معرفش هل المفروض نركز على المبرمجين اللي بيواجهوا صعوبة مع الإنجليزي ولا لأ، عشان ده برده نوع تالت من المحتوى و برده ممكن يخلي الجروپ عام و مش متخصص.

    message: "To make the decision effective, there must be a well defined way to
      moderate. The less thinking the moderators have to do, the more fair it is,
      and the easier it is for the posters to know whether they should post their
      question or not, even with low experience. I suggest two simple rules to identify
      a non-conforming question:\n1- Does it have a single well-defined answer that
      can be found by googling or by simply looking up the documentation? If so, it
      is a non-conforming question.\n2- Otherwise, a question may be considered conforming
      if it has more than one admissible answer and human expertise is required to
      identify which answer is the best for each situation. \n\nThese two rules might
      miss a few corner cases. A voting mechanism, like the one at SO, would be helpful.
      But unfortunately is not applicable here directly. In these cases, if the question
      is marked as non-conforming by these two rules, but is otherwise deemed interesting
      and should live on, members can vote in its favor by \"liking\" it. If a question
      is, on the other hand, non-conforming, but is not caught by these two rules,
      members can comment \"down\" beneath it. Eventually, these rules may be amended
      to lower the need for explicit voting. [ side note: voting by liking and commenting
      reveals the identity of the voter, which might not be so encouraging. But it's
      just a suggestion in the brain storm. ]"

      Beginner content is increasing. Should we limit it, given beginners -although are sort-of allowed in- are not the intended audience of the group?
      * The question is for experienced members and admins, not for beginner members *
