  Hi everyone, Happy Eid to you and ur beloved ones.
  I have a question, please don't elaborate unless u r sure :))
  I want to learn a server-side technology that embraces scalability and has powerful support to realtime database and a powerful db query package, and supports mysql along with object-oriented DB.
  My options are:
  1- PHP Using Laravel MVC.
  2- Nodejs.
  3- Java
  4-Python

  So where should i go, what should i do?

      it also depends on which databases you use.\n\nPython is very easy to learn
      and get started.\nJava is very powerful and has tremendous support.\nDon't go
      for php unless you really really have to. \nNode is easy but its \"javascript\"
