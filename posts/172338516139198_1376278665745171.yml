  I dont know if it's a stupid question but I'm a newbie in the field of speech...I was reading many papers about Arabic pronuncation checking and I've found that all of them follow the same steps : audio file processing, feature extraction by MFCC.. trainning and testing by HMM.
  the question is that if I have training audio files and extracted MFCC features why do I need Language model and linguist and acoustic model for trainning? I thought that these models are used in Speech recognition to detect the most likely word but what it will benifit me if my goal is only to check for pronounciation?

    message: what's the goal of your project? to check pronunciation to the level
      of letter, word or sentence? depending on your scope you'll decide which models
      to define and how (phone model, lexicon / dictionary , and language model) -
      based on your application needs each model will be as simple or as complex as
      its needs

    message: I'm only very new in speech, but my understanding is that you'll need
      to go through all the steps of Automatic Speech recognition (using the language
      model and the acoustic model) so that you will be able to detect the words and
      their boundaries, and hence you can check the pronunciation of each word.

    message: "if your training data is in form of letters , then you need a language
      model for forming words for example 3amr it is written عمرو\nalthough there
      is a missing letter \nI don't know how this model is implemented i just passed
      by it in a neural network course \nAnd there is something you can do to avoid
      having a language model , you can have the training data in form of words and
      not letters.\nYou can also use deep-learning which is harder to develop but
      will avoid modelling at the first place."
