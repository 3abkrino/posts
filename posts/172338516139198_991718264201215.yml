  Here is my experience with VPSDime if u are just interested

  "Akheeran (after 2 days of configuration), I'm done from installing & configuring Centos 7 on my new VPS. Moving from shared hosts to VPS is a must. I got my 7$ monthly VPS (Unmanaged) from VPSDime with 6GB of Ram and 30GB SSD Space. So far, its a great experience ! i didn't expect that i'd get such specification with only 7$/month. I regret the time i waste in shared hosts."
