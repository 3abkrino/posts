    message: Choices in such situation depends on the TASK and DOMAIN . i.e. if you
      need to do with chef or vagrant , then Ruby basics will be your best choice,
      as they are just big ruby scripts , and generally at automation scripting language
      is the best choice ,(edit and run, with no building hassles and dependencies
      ), if you want to involove with the cutting edge google kubernets , hashicorp  or
      swarn and docker then It is all golang ,

    message: If you know one language, use it until it the task in hand is blocked
      because it can only be done in another language or you are going in big workarounds
      to solve that. If you know both, it doesn't make a difference. If you know one
      and want to learn the other, that's a different thing.

    message: See examples of automation scripts on github or so using the same tools
      you want to use, what are most of them written in. If that's a language you
      know, cool. If not, see if the language you know is used too. If it is, and
      the experience isn't too bad, go with it, if not, invest in the other language,
      or choose other way to write the script.
