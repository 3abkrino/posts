  One of my greatest weaknesses is starting many projects and pursuing ideas only to abandon them mid-way. It's partially out of laziness, but also because I'm just not as motivated to complete said project as I once was. But here's the deal: you'll never actually complete anything and progress in your work until you ship at least a half-assed product. This isn't to say "hey, stop caring about quality and instead make a lot of mediocre work". Rather, understand that mediocre work is better than no work (for the creator and not the consumer at least).

  The only way to make actual progress is by looking back at your mistakes and old, lower quality work. Build upon the half-baked alpha v0.01 you released and cherish the fact you did something. Expose it to criticism, and have angry, opinionated people on the internet tear your hard work apart. Because in the end, getting bored and giving up is much more damaging to your ego than some harsh criticism.

      How about getting a co-worker on your project ... definitely someone out there who shares the interest .
      Gets a lot done when you have someone else on it .

    message: Well, since you think harsh criticism will not be an issue, let me put
      it this way, if you really are seeking advice I think you should have used your
      own words to describe your own problem instead of copying someone's blog just
      to sound sophisticated. Specially that the solution is perfectly described in
      the second paragraph. I cannot really see your point here.
