message: "I was wondering about ITWorx .. Is it still a good company as it used to
  be ? Because I heard a lot concerning that. Are they working on new products (maybe
  mobile apps) because I also heard they're just maintaining products the created
  before ? what is your opinion at work environment? \nThanks"

    message: Personally, I would read the Glassdoor, interview multiple people at
      different levels and find out which team I would be joining and gather intelligence
      about that specific team.

    message: Most Egyptian companies will never exceed the services/maintenance level.
      If you want to build something new or innovate join a startup (instabug and
      crowd analyzer are excellent examples) or leave Egypt.
