  am searching on the web to study for VCA certification (VMware Certified Associate 6 â€“ Data Center Virtualization) but i can't find any resources to study from all I found were some playlists on youtube and i don't know if they are fine and covers all the topics of the exam or not
  i hope i can find some help here and if there is any recommendation for a center that teaches this course i will be grateful
