  Let's discuss this:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  CAN YOU BE A SENIOR IN YOUR FIELD WITHOUT HANDS ON EXPERIENCE?
  ___________________________________________________

  I will answer my own question just as an opinion: YES! (I know its odd but it happened!)
  Two years ago, A colleague  was interviewing some developers for a senior position, and one had satisfied and met all the requirements.
  He didn't hide his shallow hands on experience weakness, but rather than that, he was perfect in all other aspects. He even challenged us if we can come up with a technical issue he cannot solve, we've thoroughly tested him in the following:
  * Oveloading, Overriding, Constructors and Destructors.
  * Static VS Object properties and methods.
  * Magic Methods __get() and __set()
  * SQL injections
  * Security best practice for accessing and retrieving data from DB.
  * DB Shriding Techniques.
  * Clustering ..
  * Cloud Computing
  * SOAP VS REST
  * Case studies.
  * Decision making.
  * Implementation Scheduling.
  * Client handling.

  .... These are what I can recall now....

  We've end up with a developer that only needs more life scenarios to be fully qualified for the position...
  Actually I was hesitating to give him the position, but the decision wasn't mine.
  However, he got it ... and he showed some serious developing skills ...
  His secret was just simple: He Never Stop Learning and Fetching New Area of Knowledge...
  So.. What do you think?
