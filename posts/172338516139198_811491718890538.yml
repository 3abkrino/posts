  I'd like to share with you a nice way to handle INotifyPropertyChanged in .Net 4.5 (WPF, WP8.1, Win8.1).
  I figured this out a few days ago, I'm using a base class for my View Models to simplify the whole process to one setter line, it makes use of CallerMemberNameAttribute and the "ref" keyword :)
