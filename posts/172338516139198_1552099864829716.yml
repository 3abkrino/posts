message: |-
  I am working on an application and each customer needs to rename the labels differently from each other. Like "Centers" may be "Labs"  for some customer, so in this example my key in the resource file is "center" and the value would be different for each customer in their own Resource file. As my code base is the same for all customers so I cannot change them in the only resource file I have in application.

      I don't think there is a general solution,
      simply think how the app can recognize the customer and do conditional if to change the labels text according to the recognition

    message: Are we talking .NET here? If so, and you want to use resources for this
      purpose (which means that you won't have a multilingual app), you can have a
      resource file per customer type instead. The VS add-in that combines that and
      provides you with the localized binaries is called MultiLingual App Toolkit.
      There is an msdn article that describes that well. If you're planning on having
      multilingual support as well, you might need a more complex solution.

    message: "It depends heavily on how you built your system, (and what is the type
      of application) if it is a web app, you may built it keeping in mind the multi-tenancy
      so that each customer have their own database that is duplicated from a master(default)
      database every time you create a customer, etc.., then you may simply store
      and cache the labels per the single customer instance.. \n\nso, the system looks
      up every customer instance by noting the server name, as you may have multiple
      domains, or subdomains linked to a single running web app, and connect to its
      database accordingly, or use the filesystem-based caching directory, etc..\nin
      this way you can control what is static/shared or cross-customer and what is
      customer dependent, and you can choose how you store the per-customer data (database,
      filesystem, cache store,etc.. using the server name or domain name as the customer
      key)"
