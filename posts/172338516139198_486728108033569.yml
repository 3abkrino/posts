  Guys, I'm planning to suggest a plan for a company about what online resources should they subscribe to, in order to have always-ready, well-crafted resources for the developers in the company. my initial suggestion is consists of 2 services:
  1- Pluralsight subscription plus: http://www.pluralsight.com/training
  2- Safari Books online: http://my.safaribooksonline.com/

  What do you think? can you suggest better alternatives ?
  Do you have any other recommendations?

  Waiting for your reply, and thanks in advance :)

  Mohammed Hossam, Mohamed Meligy, Adel K. Khalil  kindly advice :)
