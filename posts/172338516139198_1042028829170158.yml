message: is there is a way to do UPNP through java script  ?  i have been searching
  about this but the only implementations i could find ( like this one https://richtr.github.io/plug.play.js
  ) are dependent on navigator.getNetworkServices API  which apparently is only supported
  by opera now

      all I know is that UPnP is an XML-based API used by programs to configure temporary port forwarding on a router.
      I once sniffed the packets and looked at that XML and it didn't look very complicated, so it might not be that hard to implement your own?
