    message: I use it. It's great, really. Visually better than Mavericks, feature-wise
      though, not that much.

    message: Or actually that much if you have an iPhone that you can link with the
      system. I didn't try that though.

    message: I use it on a hackintosh so honestly I have no idea how does it work
      on a real Mac. I guess you wouldn't need that though.

    message: It's my first Mac so can't compare to how it was before. It's fine. It
      works. No major bugs or annoyance. I disabled the new stuff like most of the
      things that show in notifications menu though, and I don't have an iPhone.
