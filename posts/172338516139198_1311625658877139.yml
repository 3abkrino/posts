    message: Of course each one in stand alone is better, but if you want it for performance
      you may use secondary SSD drive for database as it's the one which have more
      reads and writes and needs more performance than web files.

      This is called "Infrastructure Architecture", and there's no best answer.

      However, it's always better to have three separate teirs:
      - Database
      - Backend
      - Frontend

      You can then scale each one separately, and manage changes independently.

    message: it depends on what you mean by a machine, a machine can be one computer
      with a 16 core xeon running 8 virtual machines each on it's own 2 cores, in
      that case sure you can run the 2 servers on 2 different virtual machine and
      be totally secure as any compromise in one will leave the other unharmed (unless
      it's a hardware compromise which is very rare), or it could mean both the servers
      are on the same virtual machine (same os managing both processes) then that's
      cheaper but less secure as any hack that gains root privileges can compromise
      both.

      if each on its own machine you can see how each function consumes resources, Web-CPU  vs DB-CPU, and so on. it helps you make scalability and capacity decisions.

      Also, Depending on your application, you might find that Web is CPU and Memory bound, and DB is CPU and Disk bound. then both will compete for CPU time. else, it will save power if you run on the same server.

    message: Scaling-wise, you would want them to be on different machines. Each will
      probably have its own scaling requirements like Fouad mentioned (CPU/Memory/DISK
      IO, etc ...). You can then scale them up independently of each other and provide
      replication, load balancing, etc ...
