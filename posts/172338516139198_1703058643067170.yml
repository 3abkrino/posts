message: I've a ruby on rails application where i'm using nginx as a webserver & also
  i'm using a free ssl certificate from let's encrypt and everything is working fine
  on the website and on android application which connects to the api, but iOS doesn't
  work only on specific carrier ( Etisalat UAE ) but it works fine on DU UAE and Etisalat
  isn't blocking us because the app is working on android fine. the error i get when
  i try from the iOS application is " An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection
  to the server cannot be made" , i've searched for the error but found nothing useful.
  any one faced such issue or know where the problem can be ?!
