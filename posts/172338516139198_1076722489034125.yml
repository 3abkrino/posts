message: "I have a big problem in anew project that is about to be launched in a few
  days\n\nData is concatenated and i find no better way to clone it \n\n================\nDB
  Structure : \nOne Course has many chapters ,\nEvery Chapter has many Subjects ,\nEvery
  Subject has many Questions ,\nEvery Question has many Answers .\n================================\nRequired
  cloning a course from user to another ,\n================================\nI did
  it like that :\n================\n1- select query = course\ninsert query  = new
  course -> new course  ID\n\n2- select query = chapters of course\nloop start on
  chapters\n     using new course  ID :  \n     insert query  = new chapter -> new
  chapter  ID\n\n          3- select query = subjects of chapter \n          loop
  start on subjects\n               using new chapter ID :\n               insert
  query  = new subject -> new subject ID\n\n                   4- select query = questions
  of subject \n                   loop start on Questions\n                        using
  new subject ID :    \n                        insert query  = new question -> new
  question ID\n\n                              5- and so on for answers \n\n                   loop
  end on Questions \n\n          loop end on  subjects \n\nloop end on  Chapters\n\n================================\n\nThe
  problem is that a single course could have a 400 questions\n\nand this is a massive
  no of queries to be done specially when this process is done repeatedly \n\n================================\n\nwaiting
  for your generous help :)"

      400 shouldn't be a big number, especially that you are doing the whole thing in the DB not retrieving it anyway. How long does the query take on a test machine?

      Oh wait, you mention loops. Maybe you do transfer it!

      Have you considered doing the thing in SProcs without loops? (INSERT INTO, with complex SELECTs)
