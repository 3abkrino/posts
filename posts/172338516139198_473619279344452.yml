  My first UserScripts submission.
  http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/150410
  --
  it's a script to enhance the experience of the Pluralsight (http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/NewReleases) Courses list page that will add filter/sort capabilities to it.

  PS: you will need to install GreaseMonkey Firefox addon in order to make use of this script, Chrome was supporting it natively, but since V21 they changes the security features so you will need to workaround this first.
  this link may be handy for Chrome users: http://userscripts.org/topics/115329?page=1#posts-456415
