message: "[Python] Guys , I have a python object that I want to serialize to json
  , what is the best way to go ? I need the serializer to be able to deal with unicode
  (Arabic characters for example).\nI have tried to use json.dump but it fails with
  some Arabic characters\nThis is the error I got : \n'ascii' codec can't decode byte
  0xd8 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)\nThe project is small and opensource
  , you view the code from here\n\nhttps://github.com/AhmedKamal/Shokran/blob/master/main.py"
