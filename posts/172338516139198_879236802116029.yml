message: Anyone knows how to track different cohorts (groups of people) downloading
  an extension from Chrome store? What I thought of is to generate and distribute
  different shortened URL's for each cohort, each of these URL's redirects to my server
  to generate a cookie/file containing the cohort ID and place it on the user's machine,
  and then takes the user to Chrome store to download the extension. Once downloaded,
  the extension reads the cookie/file and saves the user ID together with its cohort
  ID in the backend. I am not a developer, so I am not sure whether this is feasible
  or it's science fiction :) Your suggestions are most appreciated!

      This is somehow related to A/B testing

    message: Yes, A/B testing is usually used to help website owners track the users'
      behaviors on different versions of the same landing page. The landing page in
      my case is Chrome store's page which is -to my knowledge- totally out of control.
      So my challenge is technical in the first place and I am not sure if there are
      better solutions than the one I suggested.

    message: Maybe you can try creating 2 plugins? I don't know if Google Store policy
      will allow this or not. Try to talk to them

    message: "Your idea is very good.\n\nOne problem is that the plugin likely doesn't
      have access to read the cookie as it's running chrome not same domain.\n\nIt
      can make Ajax request to the same domain though so it reads the cookie and records
      the download (or return a result to the plugin to use to send tracking code
      from JS).\n\nIn order for this to work the domain will need to enable something
      called CORS (cross origin resource sharing) so it can get ajax requests from
      anywhere. \nThe implementation of this bit is slightly different per server
      language / framework."

      Not sure if just relying on Google analytics can save you some of this too, like record visit to custom URL in b analytics, then set analytics goal as another event or page view recorded from the plugin and just rely on these calculate conversion.

      Should be technically much easier if possible. Definitely something to consider / experiment with.

    message: Mohamed Meligy, all extensions/plugins have access to every single cookie
      on the browser if you add the correct permission to the manifest. His idea will
      indeed work.

    message: 'Thank you all! Mohamed Meligy: Yes, your idea for Google analytics may
      work to track conversions. I will think it through. However, I am not sure Google
      analytics will be helpful beyond conversion. For example, if I want to measure
      and compare the average lifespan of each cohort, I don''t think this will be
      possible through Google analytics. I guess, only a segmented database in the
      backend can help tracking all cohorts'' behaviors accurately. Thanks, again
