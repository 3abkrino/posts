message: Anyone knows how to track different cohorts (groups of people) downloading
  an extension from Chrome store? What I thought of is to generate and distribute
  different shortened URL's for each cohort, each of these URL's redirects to my server
  to generate a cookie/file containing the cohort ID and place it on the user's machine,
  and then takes the user to Chrome store to download the extension. Once downloaded,
  the extension reads the cookie/file and saves the user ID together with its cohort
  ID in the backend. I am not a developer, so I am not sure whether this is feasible
  or it's science fiction :) Your suggestions are most appreciated!
