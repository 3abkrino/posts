    message: "The platform you already know. \n\nYou don't choose a platform just
      because you want some parallelism.  Most lovely what you want can be done by
      some built in thing or a library. \n\nAnd Hadoop is not a backend language anyway"

    message: Stay away from NodeJS, it is basically single-threaded and relies heavily
      on Async I/O to be performant, but it is very unsuitable for long-running functions
      that blocks its I/O queue from proceeding quickly.
