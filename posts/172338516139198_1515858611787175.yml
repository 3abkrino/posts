message: "A small question \nI'm trying today to download a book from packtpublishing
  (you know, their daily free book) but it keeps failing. I noticed they are using
  cloudfront. All my other internet access is ok.\nIs this happening with anyone else?
  Does it have to do with the blocking of news sites?"
