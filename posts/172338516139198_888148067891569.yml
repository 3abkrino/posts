message: Graphic Designer, there is Creative Commons to protect your graphics; Software
  Developer, you just take the code and use it from stackoverflow!! Why there is protection
  for graphic designer but none for software developers code? They are both contents
  aren't they! Creative Commons should be named Graphics Commons GC.

      The code provided in StackOverflow answers (and the like) is not copy protected, and is specifically meant to be used by others.

      The same goes for any code that is available online, it always has a copyright note attached either explicitly or implicitly.

    message: There are copyrights for code. The most famous is GPL for example. Most
      people ignore that since they can embed the code within theirs and no one will
      notice, but it does not mean that it is non existent.

    message: GPL is free software license. It has nothing to do with "you can use
      my code only if you put my name in your program/site" as some graphic designers
      do with creative commons. Someone can draw an icon, and demand you to put his/her
      name in your site! if you don't then they can sue you if they want as their
      graphic is in your site/program.

    message: IIRC, you cannot use GPL code without making your own code GPL as well
      as include the original copyright notice, which contains info about the original
      code author.
