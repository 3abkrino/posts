message: Graphic Designer, there is Creative Commons to protect your graphics; Software
  Developer, you just take the code and use it from stackoverflow!! Why there is protection
  for graphic designer but none for software developers code? They are both contents
  aren't they! Creative Commons should be named Graphics Commons GC.
