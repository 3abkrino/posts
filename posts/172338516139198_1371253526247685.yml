  Should I go on with the security career or I am too late that I won't reach anything? I am a level 2 computer science student.
  I just have the fear that I am wasting my time trying to learn about something and when the time comes and I graduate I find no job as I don't have enough experience or I am not good enough, so any advice?

      Firstly, You will reach knowledge which is the most important thing. Knowledge, especially if it's in computer security, is never a waste of time. Especially that you are still a student, so it's just the right time to learn what you like, not what your employer wants.
      Secondly, Nobody starts as good enough, everybody starts as a beginner.
      Thirdly, understanding security issues better will certainly make you a better developer, even if you don't specialize in security at work.
      Finally, you can always find a job related to security whether locally or abroad one day if you have it in your mind and you are hardworking enough.
